  abstract = {Globally, root production accounts for 33\textendash{}67\% of terrestrial net primary productivity and influences decomposition via root production and turnover, carbon (C) allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and root exudation. As recognized above ground, the timing of phenological events affects terrestrial C balance, yet there is no parallel understanding for below-ground phenology. In this paper we examine the phenology of root production and its relationship to temperature, soil moisture, and above-ground phenology. Synthesizing 87 observations of whole-plant phenology from 40 studies, we found that, on average, root growth occurs 25 {$\pm$} 8 d after shoot growth but that the offset between the peak in root and shoot growth varies {$>$} 200 d across biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical). Root and shoot growth are positively correlated with median monthly temperature and mean monthly precipitation in boreal, temperate, and subtropical biomes. However, a temperature hysteresis in these biomes leads to the hypothesis that internal controls over C allocation to roots are an equally, if not more, important driver of phenology. The specific mechanisms are as yet unclear but they are likely mediated by some combination of photoassimilate supply, hormonal signaling, and growth form.},

Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain this higher rate of attrition, most of which cite family issues as the reason. However, medicine successfully recruits and retains women physicians, despite being less family friendly than biology in terms of workload, stress, and inflexible work hours. Both professions are competitive but at different times in a person's career. Competition for entry into medical school is intense, but this period of competition occurs prior to family formation for most women. For women biologists, the most intense period of competition occurs during the search for faculty positions. Many women have partners or children at this time. The increasing competition for academic positions threatens to reverse the gains that women have made into the professoriate in biology, as well as in other sciences.},

Location\hspace{0.6em} Twenty-one sites on an elevation gradient of 1500~m on the San Francisco Peaks, northern Arizona, USA. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Tree-ring data for the years 1950\textendash{}2000 for eight tree species (Abies lasiocarpa var. arizonica (Merriam) Lemm., Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., Pinus aristata Engelm., Pinus edulis Engelm., Pinus flexilis James, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws., Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco and Quercus gambelii Nutt.) were used to compare sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought and temperature among co-occurring species at the same site, and between sites that differed in elevation and species composition. Results\hspace{0.6em} For Picea engelmannii, Pinus flexilis, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, trees in drier, low-elevation stands generally had greater sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought than trees of the same species in wetter, high-elevation stands. Species low in their elevational range had greater drought sensitivity than co-occurring species high in their elevational range at the pinyon-juniper/ponderosa pine forest ecotone, ponderosa pine/mixed conifer forest ecotone and high-elevation invaded meadows, but not at the mixed conifer/subalpine forest ecotone. Sensitivity of radial growth to regional drought was greater at drier, low-elevation compared with wetter, high-elevation forests. Yearly growth was positively correlated with measures of regional water availability at all sites, except high-elevation invaded meadows where growth was weakly correlated with all climatic factors. Yearly growth in high-elevation forests up to 3300~m a.s.l. was more strongly correlated with water availability than temperature. Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Severe regional drought reduced growth of all dominant tree species over a gradient of precipitation and temperature represented by a 1500-m change in elevation, but response to drought varied between species and stands. Growth was reduced the most in drier, low-elevation forests and in species growing low in their elevational range in ecotones, and the least for trees that had recently invaded high-elevation meadows. Constraints on tree growth from drought and high temperature are important for high-elevation subalpine forests located near the southern-most range of the dominant species.},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival.

However, complete exclusion required 300\textendash{} 400 years, indicating small fitness differences among species.

  abstract = {How strong is the natural selection that maintains species and locally adapted populations in the face of gene flow? To what extent is genomic divergence limited by gene flow? Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and the genome-wide variation in recombination rate to infer the strength and timing of selection, and the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. To achieve this, we develop theory that merges the coalescent process with the concept of effective gene flow. The latter describes the reduction in gene flow at neutral loci due to divergent selection against maladapted immigrant alleles. This effect decreases with recombinational distance from the loci under selection, such that in regions of low recombination genetic divergence among populations is on average increased compared to regions of high recombination. Our inference procedure exploits this relationship in a genome-wide aggregate manner. We validate our approach using individual-based simulations and apply it to two datasets from the yellow monkeyflower ( Mimulus guttatus ). First, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. We show that the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus may usually experience when adapting to local conditions. Second, we quantify and date selection against introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus . Our study provides a theoretical framework that explicitly links genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms.},

I focus particularly on multivariate defense against insect herbivores, which is the simultaneous deployment of multiple traits, often arranged as convergently evolved defense syndromes. Answering many of the outstanding questions in the biology of plant defense will require generating broad hypotheses that can be explicitly tested by using comparative approaches and interpreting phylogenetic patterns. The comparative approach has wide-spread potential to reinvigorate tests of classic hypotheses about the evolution of interspecific interactions. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In heterogeneous landscapes, the genetic and demographic consequences of dispersal influence the evolution of niche width. Unless pollen is limiting, pollen dispersal does not contribute directly to population growth. However, by disrupting local adaptation, it indirectly affects population dynamics. We compare the effect of pollen versus seed dispersal on the evolution of niche width in heterogeneous habitats, explicitly considering the feedback between maladaptation and demography. We consider two scenarios: the secondary contact of two subpopulations, in distinct, formerly isolated habitats, and the colonization of an empty habitat with dispersal between the new and ancestral habitat. With an analytical model, we identify critical levels of genetic variance leading to niche contraction (secondary contact scenario), or expansion (new habitat scenario). We confront these predictions with simulations where the genetic variance freely evolves. Niche contraction occurs when habitats are very different. It is faster as total gene flow increases or as pollen predominates in overall gene flow. Niche expansion occurs when habitat heterogeneity is not too high. Seed dispersal accelerates it, whereas pollen dispersal tends to retard it. In both scenarios very high seed dispersal leads to extinction. Overall, our results predict a wider niche for species dispersing seeds more than pollen.},

Several quantitative genetics models predict that species escaping extinction will change their geographical distribution while keeping the same ecological niche. We introduce pollen dispersal in these models, which affects gene flow but not directly colonization. We show that plant populations may escape extinction because of both spatial range and ecological niche shifts. Exact analytical formulas predict that increasing pollen dispersal distance slows the expected spatial range shift and accelerates the ecological niche shift. There is an optimal distance of pollen dispersal, which maximizes the sustainable rate of climate change. These conclusions hold in simulations relaxing several strong assumptions of our analytical model. Our results imply that, for plants with long distance of pollen dispersal, models assuming niche conservatism may not accurately predict their future distribution under climate change.},

  abstract = {The Climate System Model, a coupled global climate model without "flux adjustments'' recently developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was used to simulate the twentieth-century climate using historical greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol forcing. This simulation was extended through the twenty-first century under two newly developed scenarios, a business-as-usual case (ACACIA-BAU, CO2 approximate to 710 ppmv in 2100) and a CO2 stabilization case (STA550, CO2 approximate to 540 ppmv in 2100). Here we compare the simulated and observed twentieth-century climate, and then describe the simulated climates for the twenty-first century. The model simulates the spatial and temporal variations of the twentieth-century climate reasonably well. These include the rapid rise in global and zonal mean surface temperatures since the late 1970s, the precipitation increases over northern mid- and high-latitude land areas, ENSO-induced precipitation anomalies, and Pole-midlatitude oscillations (such as the North Atlantic oscillation) in sea level pressure fields. The model has a cold bias (2 degrees -6 degreesC) in surface air temperature over land, overestimates of cloudiness (by 10\%-30\%) over land, and underestimates of marine stratus clouds to the west of North and South America and Africa.The projected global surface warming from the 1990s to the 2090s is similar to1.9 degreesC under the BAU scenario and similar to1.5 degreesC under the STA550 scenario. In both cases, the midstratosphere cools due to the increase in CO2, whereas the lower stratosphere warms in response to recovery of the ozone layer. As in other coupled models, the surface warming is largest at winter high latitudes (greater than or equal to5.0 degreesC from the 1990s to the 2090s) and smallest (similar to1.0 degreesC) over the southern oceans, and is larger over land areas than ocean areas. Globally averaged precipitation increases by similar to3.5\% (3.0\%) from the 1990s to the 2090s in the BAU (STA550) case. In the BAU case, large precipitation increases (up to 50\%) occur over northern mid- and high latitudes and over India and the Arabian Peninsula. Marked differences occur between the BAU and STA550 regional precipitation changes resulting from interdecadal variability. Surface evaporation increases at all latitudes except for 60 degrees -90 degreesS. Water vapor from increased tropical evaporation is transported into mid- and high latitudes and returned to the surface through increased precipitation there. Changes in soil moisture content are small (within +/-3\%). Total cloud cover changes little, although there is an upward shift of midlevel clouds. Surface diurnal temperature range decreases by about 0.2 degrees -0.5 degreesC over most land areas. The 2-8-day synoptic storm activity decreases (by up to 10\%) at low latitudes and over midlatitude oceans, but increases over Eurasia and Canada. The cores of subtropical jets move slightly up- and equatorward. Associated with reduced latitudinal temperature gradients over mid- and high latitudes, the wintertime Ferrel cell weakens (by 10\%-15\%). The Hadley circulation also weakens (by similar to 10\%), partly due to the upward shift of cloudiness that produces enhanced warming in the upper troposphere.},

The results confirm some results from previous chamber experiments: light-saturated carbon uptake, diurnal C assimilation, growth and above-ground production increased, while specific leaf area and stomatal conductance decreased in elevated [CO(2)]. There were differences in FACE. Trees were more responsive than herbaceous species to elevated [CO(2)]. Grain crop yields increased far less than anticipated from prior enclosure studies. The broad direction of change in photosynthesis and production in elevated [CO(2)] may be similar in FACE and enclosure studies, but there are major quantitative differences: trees were more responsive than other functional types; C(4) species showed little response; and the reduction in plant nitrogen was small and largely accounted for by decreased Rubisco. The results from this review may provide the most plausible estimates of how plants in their native environments and field-grown crops will respond to rising atmospheric [CO(2)]; but even with FACE there are limitations, which are also discussed.},

The results from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments were summarized via meta-analysis to quantify the mean responses of stomatal and photosynthetic parameters to elevated [CO2 ]. Eleva- tion of [CO2] in FACE experiments reduced stomatal con- ductance by 22\%, yet, this reduction was not associated with a similar change in stomatal density. Elevated [CO2 ] stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat ) in C3 plants grown in FACE by an average of 31\%. However, the magnitude of the increase in Asat varied with functional group and environment. Functional groups with ribulose- 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-limited photosynthesis at elevated [CO2 ] had greater potential for increases in Asat than those where photosynthesis became ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RubP)-limited at elevated [CO2 ]. Both nitrogen supply and sink capacity modulated the response of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2] through their impact on the acclimation of carboxylation capacity. Increased understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which plants respond to elevated [CO2 ], and the feedback of environmental factors upon them, will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to rising [CO2 ] and increase our potential to adapt crops and managed ecosystems to future atmospheric [CO2].},

Genetic variation in carbon isotope ratios was assessed for varieties, populations within varieties, and families within populations of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga rnenziesii (Mirb.)

Earlywood was sampled from the fourth annual ring of 19-year-old trees from four populations, two from each variety (var, lneuziesii and var. glauca), growing in a common garden experiment. Coastal genotypes from wetter source environmcnts consistently discriminated less against "C, and thus had higher WUE's, than did interior genotypes from drier source environments. The differences between the two varieties were small but significant (P{$<$}0.05). Similarly, within varieties, populations from the wetter source consistently discriminated more against "C, although the differences were small (0.10{$<$}p{$<$}0.05).

Carr] have little within-population genetic structure, peripheral populations are strongly spatially structured at distances up to 500~m. Here we explore the implications of this difference in structure on ex situ gene conservation collections and estimates of genetic diversity from research collections. We test the effects of varying the number of individuals sampled and the total area they are sampled across on capture of neutral genetic variation in collections from core, continuous versus peripheral, disjunct populations. Bivariate response surface analysis of genetic marker data for eight sequence tagged site loci from core and peripheral populations suggest that a population sample from 150 trees covering at least 225~ha would be adequate for capturing 95\% of the genetic diversity (as measured by allelic richness or expected heterozygosity) in core populations. However, a larger sample of 180 individuals from an area of at least 324~ha is needed in peripheral populations to capture the same proportion of standing variation because of stronger within-population spatial genetic structure. Standard population sampling protocols for estimating among and within-population genetic diversity would significantly underestimate the within-population allelic richness and expected heterozygosity of peripheral but not core populations, potentially leading to poor representation of genetic variation in peripheral populations as well as erroneous conclusions about their genetic impoverishment.},

The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

  abstract = {Forests provide thousands of jobs and billions of dollars worth of employment income, tax revenue, and economic activity to Canadians. In addition, they provide a broad range of ecosystem services including water, recreation, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. All of these benefits depend on healthy forests, but climate change is threatening forest health by causing a mismatch between the natural genetics of tree populations that are adapted to specific climatic areas and the new climates they now face due to climate change. In BC and Alberta, about 150 million spruce and lodgepole pine trees are planted annually by forest companies and provincial agencies. Typically, foresters collect and use seed locally for this planting. In the past, the resulting seedlings were well-adapted to the locations in which they were planted. However, a rapidly changing climate threatens forest health and productivity, and is predicted to result in widespread maladaptation of trees. Evidence for this maladaptation can be seen with higher losses to pests, such as to the mountain pine beetle in BC, and aspen and spruce dieback in Alberta over the past decade. This project is a large-scale effort to apply state-of-the art genomics and climate-mapping technologies to the problem of matching existing and naturally occurring genetic populations of interior spruce and lodgepole pine with the appropriate climate areas under climate change. Information generated will help the provincial forestry agencies in BC and Alberta structure policy for tree planting to ensure the proper matching of tree seed source with planting environment under climate change. With direction from appropriate, knowledge-based policy, foresters working to replant harvested areas will be able to make informed decisions regarding seed source, and thereby improve the long-term health of public forests and in doing so, have an economic impact on the benefits that flow from these forests of up to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.},

  abstract = {Geographic variation in trees has been investigated since the mid-18th century. Similar patterns of clinal variation have been observed along latitudinal and elevational gradients in common garden experiments for many temperate and boreal species. These studies convinced forest managers that a 'local is best' seed source policy was usually safest for reforestation. In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and refined but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene flow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene flow (AGF), the translocation of pre-adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufficiently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species-specific knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty. New knowledge will continue to refine and improve AGF as climates warm further. \textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

To weigh the risks of AFG against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow.

  abstract = {Evolutionary responses are required for tree populations to be able to track climate change. Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90\% and 78\% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes.},

  abstract = {The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis can cause both positive and negative feedback with trees under elevated CO2. Positive feedback arises if the additional carbon (C) increases both nutrient uptake by the fungus and nutrient transfer to the plant, whereas negative feedback results from increased nutrient uptake and immobilization by the fungus and reduced transfer to the plant. Because species of ECM fungi differ in their C and nitrogen (N) demand, understanding fungal species-specific responses to variation in C and N supply is essential to predict impacts of global change. We investigated fungal species-specific responses of ECM Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings under ambient and elevated CO2 (350 or 700 mu L L-1 CO2) and under low and high mineral N availability. Each seedling was associated with one of the following ECM species: Hebeloma cylindrosporum, Laccaria bicolor and Suillus bovinus. The experiment lasted 103 days. During the final 27 days, seedlings were labeled with (CO2)-C-14 and N-15. Most plant and fungal parameters were significantly affected by fungal species, CO2 level and N supply. Interactions between fungal species and CO2 were also regularly significant. At low N availability, elevated CO2 had the smallest impact on the photosynthetic performance of seedlings inoculated with H. cylindrosporum and the largest impact on seedlings with S. bovinus. At ambient CO2, increasing N supply had the smallest impact on seedlings inoculated with S. bovinus and the largest on seedlings inoculated with H. cylindrosporum. At low N availability, extraradical hyphal length increased after doubling CO2 level, but this was significant only for L. bicolor. At ambient CO2, increasing N levels reduced hyphal length for both H. cylindrosporum and S. bovinus, but not for L. bicolor. We discuss the potential interplay of two major elements of global change, elevated CO2 and increased N availability, and their effects on plant growth. We conclude that increased N supply potentially relieves mycorrhiza-induced progressive N limitation under elevated CO2.},

Over time, tree populations have become adapted to their habitats including the local ecological disturbances they face. As the planet enters a phase of human-induced climate change of unprecedented speed and magnitude, however, previously locally-adapted populations are rendered less suitable for new conditions, and 'natural' biotic and abiotic disturbances are taken outside their historic distribution, frequency and intensity ranges. Tree populations rely on phenotypic plasticity to survive in extant locations, on genetic adaptation to modify their local phenotypic optimum or on migration to new suitable environmental conditions. The rate of required change, however, may outpace the ability to respond, and tree species and populations may become locally extinct after specific, but as yet unknown and unquantified, tipping points are reached. Here, we review the importance of forest genetic resources as a source of evolutionary potential for adaptation to changes in climate and other ecological factors. We particularly consider climate-related responses in the context of linkages to disturbances such as pests, diseases and fire, and associated feedback loops. The importance of management strategies to conserve evolutionary potential is emphasised and recommendations for policy-makers are provided.},

Change in climatic conditions however is an emerging factor that could prove crucial regarding the timing of flowering and synchronization among clones and thus, the quality and quantity of seed production. The temporal and spatial variation in flowering phenology and the duration of flowering were studied in consecutive years in a Pinus nigra Arn. seed orchard. Sixty plus trees representing the distribution of the species in Northern Greece were used to establish the seed orchard, and nineteen ramets per clone were planted in a honeycomb experimental design in order to avoid kinship. Temporal variation among clones, as well as spatial variation among ramets within clones growing at different sites of the orchard were recorded, for initiation and duration of male and female flowering. The majority of clones were synchronized in dates of flowering during the year with weather conditions close to the long-term climatic conditions, except for a limited number of clones that were precocious or late flowering. The pronounced variability in climatic conditions over the 2 years strongly affected the flowering and synchronization among clones, resulting in almost complete asynchrony during the xerothermic year, which was characterized by a prolonged mean monthly temperature increase of 2.3\textdegree{}C and a water deficit of 53\% in a 7-month-period (November to May). These results suggest that one of the effects of a warmer and drier climate may be the lack of flowering synchronization, as pollen shedding might be completed before female conelets reach the phase of receptivity. The restriction of male parentage to a limited number of clones severely violates the panmixia assumption and could result in fertilization failure. The projected climate change for the Mediterranean region could potentially prove detrimental for fertility and flowering synchronization of forest trees, having consequences on the quantity and genetic diversity of the seed crop in seed orchards, and the natural regeneration of forest trees in forest ecosystems due to the reduced percentage of sound seed.},

Here we report the most rapid landscape-scale shift of a woody ecotone ever documented: in northern New Mexico in the 1950s, the ecotone between semiarid ponderosa pine forest and pinon-juniper woodland shifted extensively (2 km or more) and rapidly ({$<$}5 years) through mortality of ponderosa pines in response to a severe drought. This shift has persisted for 40 years. Forest patches within the shift zone became much more fragmented, and soil erosion greatly accelerated. The rapidity and the complex dynamics of the persistent shift point to the need to represent more accurately these dynamics, especially the mortality factor, in assessments of the effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

  abstract = {Patterns, mechanisms, projections, and consequences of tree mortality and associated broad-scale forest die-off due to drought accompanied by warmer temperatures\textemdash{}''hotter drought'', an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene\textemdash{}are the focus of rapidly expanding literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO 2 ] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.},

Of these, two (the tilted-plume and Godson models) are already extant in the literature and take the form of partial differential equations based on considerations of the fluxes of suspended seeds.  The other two are original and are based on a stochastic approach to modeling the trajectories of individual seeds, obtaining the seed shadow as the probability distribution of the dispersal distances of a large number of individual seeds.  Some numerical and analytical results are presented for these four models, particularly concerning the dependence of mean and modal dispersal distances on seed settling velocity and plant height.  I also present the results of a simple experiment on the effects of seed-release height and ground-surface type on dispersal distances.  Both factors, as well as their interaction, are statistically significant.  Other microclimate variables were measured, allowing me to obtain estimates of the parameters of the four seed-shadow models presented previously.  The predictions of the four models based on these independently obtained parameter estimates are compared with the data.  Mechanistic models of seed dispersal can provide precise descriptions of seed shadows, which promise to provide further insights into the evolution of dispersal ability and its role in population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Forest regeneration following disturbance is a key ecological process, influencing forest structure and function, species assemblages, and ecosystem-climate interactions. Climate change may alter forest recovery dynamics or even prevent recovery, triggering feedbacks to the climate system, altering regional biodiversity, and affecting the ecosystem services provided by forests. Multiple lines of evidence - including global-scale patterns in forest recovery dynamics; forest responses to experimental manipulation of CO2 , temperature, and precipitation; forest responses to the climate change that has already occurred; ecological theory; and ecosystem and earth system models - all indicate that the dynamics of forest recovery are sensitive to climate. However, synthetic understanding of how atmospheric CO2 and climate shape trajectories of forest recovery is lacking. Here, we review these separate lines of evidence, which together demonstrate that the dynamics of forest recovery are being impacted by increasing atmospheric CO2 and changing climate. Rates of forest recovery generally increase with CO2 , temperature, and water availability. Drought reduces growth and live biomass in forests of all ages, having a particularly strong effect on seedling recruitment and survival. Responses of individual trees and whole-forest ecosystems to CO2 and climate manipulations often vary by age, implying that forests of different ages will respond differently to climate change. Furthermore, species within a community typically exhibit differential responses to CO2 and climate, and altered community dynamics can have important consequences for ecosystem function. Age- and species-dependent responses provide a mechanism by which climate change may push some forests past critical thresholds such that they fail to recover to their previous state following disturbance. Altered dynamics of forest recovery will result in positive and negative feedbacks to climate change. Future research on this topic and corresponding improvements to earth system models will be a key to understanding the future of forests and their feedbacks to the climate system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Proteins play a key role in cellular life. They do not act alone but are organised in complexes. Throughout the life of a cell, complexes are dynamic in their composition due to attachments and shared components. Experimental and computational evidence indicate that consecutive addition and secondary losses of components played a major role in the evolution of some complexes, mostly without affecting the core function. Here, we analysed in a large scale approach whether this flexibility in evolution is only limited to a distinct number of complexes or represents a more general trend.RESULTS:Focussing on human protein complexes, we based our analysis on a manually curated dataset from HPRD. In total, 1,060 complexes with 6,136 proteins from 2,187 unique genes were considered. We computed interologs in 25 different species and predicted the composition of complexes. Over the analysed species, the composition of most complexes was highly flexible and only 25\% of all genes were never lost. Even if one component was lost at a particular point in time, the fraction of observed second, independent losses of additional components was high (75\% of all complexes affected). Still, loss of whole complexes happened rarely. This biological signal deviated significantly from random models. We exemplified this trend on the anaphase promoting complex (APC) where a core is highly conserved throughout all metazoans, but flexibility in certain components is additions and losses of distinct units is a fundamental process in the evolution of protein complexes. These evolutionary events affecting genes coding for units in human protein complexes showed a significantly different phylogenetic pattern compared to randomly selected genes. Determination of taxon specific attachments or losses might be linked to specific cellular or morphological features. Thus, protein complexes contain not only structural and functional, but also evolutionary cores.},

The most pronounced changes were observed during the second half of the 20th century, and differed between stands. Three sites kept a constant ci/ca ratio, leading to significant ci and iWUE increases (active response to ca); whereas a significant increase in ci/ca resulted in the lowest iWUE increase of all stands at a relict Pinus uncinata forest site (passive response to ca). A significant decrease in ci/ca led to the greatest iWUE improvement at the northwestern site.We tested the climatic signal strength registered in the d13C series after removing the low-frequency trends due to the physiological responses to increasing ca. We found stronger correlations with temperature during the growing season, demonstrating that the physiological response to ca changes modulated d13C and masked the climate signal. Since 1970 higher d13C values revealed iWUE improvements at all the sites exceeding values expected by an active response to the ca increase alone. These patterns were related to upward trends in temperatures, indicating that other factors are reinforcing stomatal closure in these forests. Narrower rings during the second half of the 20th century than in previous centuries were observed at four sites and after 1970 at all sites, providing no evidence for a possible CO2 `fertilization' effect on growth. The iWUE improvements found for all the forests, reflecting both a ca rise and warmer conditions, seem to be insufficient to compensate for the negative effects of the increasing water limitation on growth.},

  abstract = {Isolation by adaptation increases divergence at neutral loci when natural selection against immigrants reduces the rate of gene flow between different habitats. This can occur early in the process of adaptive divergence and is a key feature of ecological speciation. Despite the ability of isolation by distance (IBD) and other forms of landscape resistance to produce similar patterns of neutral divergence within species, few studies have used landscape genetics to control for these other forces. We have studied the divergence of Helianthus petiolaris ecotypes living in active sand dunes and adjacent non-dune habitat, using landscape genetics approaches, such as circuit theory and multiple regression of distance matrices, in addition to coalescent modelling. Divergence between habitats was significant, but not strong, and was shaped by IBD. We expected that increased resistance owing to patchy and unfavourable habitat in the dunes would contribute to divergence. Instead, we found that landscape resistance models with lower resistance in the dunes performed well as predictors of genetic distances among subpopulations. Nevertheless, habitat class remained a strong predictor of genetic distance when controlling for isolation by resistance and IBD. We also measured environmental variables at each site and confirmed that specific variables, especially soil nitrogen and vegetation cover, explained a greater proportion of variance in genetic distance than did landscape or the habitat classification alone. Asymmetry in effective population sizes and numbers of migrants per generation was detected using coalescent modelling with Bayesian inference, which is consistent with incipient ecological speciation being driven by the dune habitat.},

Acacia falcata seeds collected from four latitudes, encompassing the current coastal range of the species (1150 km), were grown in the same soil type and climatic conditions in a glasshouse. Plants were then transplanted to two sites, 280 km north of A. falcata's current coastal range; the transplant sites were 1.2 and 5.5 1C warmer than the northernmost and southernmost boundaries of the species' current range, respectively. We compared the structure and composition of the herbivorous Hemiptera and Coleoptera communities on the transplants (i) to that of A. falcata within its current distribution, (ii) to a closely related Acacia species (Acacia leptostachya) that naturally occurred at the transplant sites, and (iii) among the A. falcata transplants originating from seeds collected at different latitudes. Herbivory on A. falcata was also compared between the transplants and the current distribution, and among transplant originating from different latitudes. Thirty species of externally feeding herbivorous Coleoptera and Hemiptera were collected from the transplanted A. falcata over a period of 12 months following transplantation. Guild structure of this herbivore community (based on the proportion of species within each of seven groups based on taxonomy and feeding style) did not significantly differ between the transplants and that found on A. falcata within its natural range, but did differ between the transplants and A. leptostachya. Rates of herbivory did not significantly differ between the transplants and plants at sites within the natural range. There were no significant differences in herbivore species richness or overall rates of herbivory on the transplants originating from different latitudes. In conclusion, host plant identity was apparently more important than climate in influencing the structure of the colonizing herbivore community. If this result holds for other plant\textendash{}herbivore systems, we might expect that under a warmer climate, broad patterns in insect community structure and rates of herbivory may remain similar to that at present, even though species composition may change substantially.},

Variation among clones in cold-injury scores was significant (p {$<$} 0.01) for all shoot tissues in both fall and spring and averaged about three times the magnitude previously observed among open-pollinated families of this species. Thus, improving cold hardiness by within-family selection appears to hold much promise. Striking similarities in relative magnitudes of heritability estimates and genetic correlations in the full-sib family, compared with breeding populations, support the following hypotheses about the quantitative genetics of cold hardiness in this species: (i) heritability of cold hardiness (both broad-and-narrow-sense) is stronger in the spring than in the fall; (ii) cold hardiness of different shoot tissues in the same season is controlled by many of the same genes; and (iii) genetic control of fall cold hardiness is largely independent of cold hardiness in the spring.},

Seedlings of these families were grown in raised nursery beds and subjected to three moisture regimes each in the second (well-watered or control, mild, and moderate drought) and third (control, severe drought, and recovery from second-year moderate drought) seasons. Traits assessed included drought hardiness (foliage damage, cavitation of xylem tracheids, xylem hydraulic conductivity, and height and diameter growth increment) in the drought treatments, growth potential (total height and diameter) in the control treatment, and height and diameter growth increments in the recovery treatment. Xylem cavitation in the growth ring produced in a particular year was nearly three times greater under the moderate drought and four times greater under the severe drought than in the control treatment. Xylem hydraulic conductivity of seedlings in the severe drought treatment was 40\% lower than conductivity of seedlings under the control treatment. Mean foliage damage in seedlings subjected to severe drought (third season) was much greater (33\%) than in seedlings subjected to mild or moderate drought (second season). Families differed significantly in most drought hardiness traits, with individual tree heritabilities averaging 0.19. Thus, much potential exists for identifying drought-hardy families at the seedling stage and using this information for deployment or breeding purposes. In addition, most hardiness traits were strongly intercorrelated (genetic correlations often exceeded |0.80|) indicating that these traits are controlled largely by the same set of genes and that selection for hardiness based on one trait will increase hardiness as reflected in the other traits as well. Genetic correlations were only moderate (0.49) between hardiness traits measured in different years, perhaps due to the large difference in severity of the drought applied in the two seasons. Although injury to seedlings, as reflected in foliage damage and xylem cavitation, was relatively low under the moderate drought of the second season, it did result in reduced growth increment the following (recovery) year. Growth potential under favorable moisture regimes was nearly uncorrelated with drought hardiness, suggesting that drought hardiness could be improved in this southwestern British Columbia breeding population without negatively impacting growth potential in favorable moisture conditions.},

Hypotheses for the evolutionary stability of geographic ranges assume that species are maladapted at the range boundary and unfit beyond the current range, but this assumption has rarely been tested. To examine how fitness varies across species' ranges, we reciprocally transplanted two species of monkeyflowers, Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii, within and beyond their present elevation ranges. We used individuals of known parentage from populations collected across the elevation ranges of both species to examine whether populations are adapted to position within the range. For both species we found the greatest average fitness at elevations central within the range, reduced fitness at the range margin, and zero or near-zero fitness when transplanted beyond their present elevation range limits. However, the underlying causes of fitness variation differed between the species. At high elevations beyond its range, M. cardinalis displayed reduced growth and fecundity, whereas at low elevations M. lewisii experienced high mortality. Weak differences in performance were observed among populations within each species and these were not related to elevation of origin. Low fitness of both species at their range margin and weak differentiation among populations within each species suggest that adaptation to the environment at and beyond the range margin is hindered, illustrating that range margins provide an interesting system in which to study limits to adaptation.},

Many expectations for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations at the range margin rest on the concordance of geographic limits and the limits of a species' ecological niche. If range limits are coincident with niche limits, then marginal populations should have lower and/or more variable vital rates and population growth rates than central populations. Using data from 8 annual censuses of marked individuals, I investigated the demography of Mimulus cardinalis and Mimulus lewisii across the species' elevation ranges. Central and marginal populations exhibited striking demographic differences, but only for one species were differences in expected directions. Marginal populations from the M. lewisii lower elevation range limit had lower and more variable survival than central populations and appeared to be demographic sinks. In contrast, marginal populations from the M. cardinalis upper elevation limit had higher fecundity and higher population growth rates than central populations. Although the species differed with respect to central-marginal patterns, they were concordant with respect to elevation; that is, both species had higher fitness in higher reaches of their examined ranges. Potential explanations for these patterns include source-sink dynamics, with asymmetrical gene flow mediated by river currents, and climate change, with recent warming shifting the species' climatic envelopes to higher elevations. Hence, assessment of spatiotemporal variation in both demography and dispersal is necessary to fully understand the relationship between the niche and species' distributions.},

We analyse thermal tolerances of a large number of terrestrial ectotherm (n~=~697), endotherm (n~=~227) and plant (n~=~1816) species worldwide, and show that tolerance to heat is largely conserved across lineages, while tolerance to cold varies between and within species. This pattern, previously documented for ectotherms, is apparent for this group and for endotherms and plants, challenging the longstanding view that physiological tolerances of species change continuously across climatic gradients. An alternative view is proposed in which the thermal component of climatic niches would overlap across species more than expected. We argue that hard physiological boundaries exist that constrain evolution of tolerances of terrestrial organisms to high temperatures. In contrast, evolution of tolerances to cold should be more frequent. One consequence of conservatism of upper thermal tolerances is that estimated niches for cold-adapted species will tend to underestimate their upper thermal limits, thereby potentially inflating assessments of risk from climate change. In contrast, species whose climatic preferences are close to their upper thermal limits will unlikely evolve physiological tolerances to increased heat, thereby being predictably more affected by warming.},

Although improvements in data and methods will have some effect, the usefulness of these models is contingent on their appropriate use, and they will improve mainly via better awareness of their conceptual basis, strengths, and limitations.},

However, recent studies have demonstrated significant variability in model predictions and there remains a pressing need to validate models and to reduce uncertainties. Model validation is problematic as predictions are made for events that have not yet occurred. Resubstituition and data partitioning of present-day data sets are, therefore, commonly used to test the predictive performance of models. However, these approaches suffer from the problems of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the calibration and validation sets. Using observed distribution shifts among 116 British breeding-bird species over the past \$ 20 years, we are able to provide a first independent validation of four envelope modelling techniques under climate change. Results showed good to fair predictive performance on independent validation, although rules used to assess model performance are difficult to interpret in a decision-planning context. We also showed that measures of performance on nonindependent data provided optimistic estimates of models' predictive ability on independent data. Artificial neural networks and generalized additive models provided generally more accurate predictions of species range shifts than generalized linear models or classification tree analysis. Data for independent model validation and replication of this study are rare and we argue that perfect validation may not in fact be conceptually possible. We also note that usefulness of models is contingent on both the questions being asked and the techniques used. Implementations of species\textendash{}climate envelope models for testing hypotheses and predicting future events may prove wrong, while being potentially useful if put into appropriate context.},

A phenological model driven by accumulated cold degree-days and photoperiod reproduces most of the interspecific and interannual variability in the timing of autumn colors. We use this process-oriented model to predict changes in the phenology of autumn colors to 2099, showing that, while responses vary among species, climate change under standard IPCC projections will lead to an overall increase in the amount of autumn colors for most species.},

Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts significantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protection was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.},

An increase in the CO2 concentration can therefore be expected to change the competitive interactions between C3 and C4 species. The effect of long term exposure to elevated CO2 (ambient CO2 concentration + 340 ,umol CO2 mol 1) on a salt marsh vege tation with both C3 and C4 species was investigated. Elevated CO2 increased the biomass of the C3 sedge Scirpus olneyi growing in a pure stand, while the biomass of the C4 grass Spartinapatens in a monospecific community was not affected. In the mixed C3/C4 community the C3 sedge showed a very large relative increase in biomass in elevated CO2 while the biomass of the C4 species declined. The C4 grass Spartina patens dominated the higher areas of the salt marsh, while the C3 sedge Scirpus olneyi was most abundant at the lower elevations, and the mixed community occupied intermediate el evations. Scirpus growth may have been restricted by drought and salt stress at the higher elevations, while Spartina growth at the lower elevations may be affected by the higher frequency of flooding. Ele vated CO2 may affect the species distribution in the salt marsh if it allows Scirpus to grow at higher elevations where it in turn may affect the growth of Spartina.},

However, the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may alter these predictions because high plasticity may amplify phenotype-environment mismatches. Although previous studies have highlighted this potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments, they have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of evolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity. We investigate this question here by integrating stochastic demography with quantitative genetic theory in a model with simultaneous change in the mean and predictability (temporal autocorrelation) of the environment. We develop an approximate prediction of long-term persistence under the new pattern of environmental fluctuations, and compare it with numerical simulations for short- and long-term extinction risk. We find that reduced predictability increases extinction risk and reduces persistence because it increases stochastic load during rescue. This understanding of how stochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and evolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in a novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the emergence of chemical resistance in pests.},

Location An experimental jack pine plantation was set up in 1992, c. 300 km north of the present distribution limit of the species, in the Boniface river area of northern Quebec (57degrees43' N, 76degrees05' W). Methods Climate and fire data were used to compare sites at and north of the present distribution limit of jack pine. In 2001, surviving individuals from the plantation were measured (total height, annual shoot elongation, basal diameter, and presence/absence of cones). Results Climate data from the ten weather stations used in this study did not show major differences. The northern limit of jack pine distribution is closely associated with the occurrence of fires larger than 200 ha. Survival of the planted jack pines was 31\%. About 25\% of the surviving pines qualified as normal, single-stem individuals; the others were slightly uprooted and/or showed marks of erosion or foraging. Cones were produced, although no viable seeds were found. Main conclusions The low number of degree-days above 5 degreesC at the plantation site could explain why the seeds were not viable. However, such climate conditions are not sufficient to prevent growth, as was shown by annual shoot elongation measurements. Most of the surviving jack pines from the Boniface river plantation are relatively healthy and follow a normal developmental programme. Low fire frequency and small fire size are amongst the main factors that prevented P. banksiana from migrating further north or east following deglaciation in northern Quebec and Labrador.},

Principal component analysis shows that two significant and independent patterns explain roughly half of the total variance in the timing of spring onset from 1920 to 2005. However, these patterns of spring onset do not appear to be linear responses to the primary modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere: the Pacific\textendash{}North American pattern (PNA) and the northern annular mode (NAM). Instead, over the period when reanalysis data and the spring index model overlap (1950\textendash{}2005), the patterns of spring onset are local responses to the state of both the PNA and NAM, which together modulate the onset date of spring by 10\textendash{}20 days on interannual time scales. They do so by controlling the number and intensity of warm days. There is also a regionwide trend in spring advancement of about -1.5 days decade-1 from 1950 to 2005. Trends in the NAM and PNA can only explain about one-third (-0.5 day decade-1) of this trend.},

Several non-mutually exclusive processes can help to reconcile the apparent paradox of selection for early flowering. We outline four: selection through other fitness components may counter observed fecundity selection for early flowering; asymmetry in the flowering-time\textendash{}fitness function may make selection for later flowering hard to detect; flowering time and fitness may be condition-dependent; and selection on flowering duration is largely unaccounted for.

  abstract = {It was shown previously that the long lifespan and juvenile phase of trees strongly attenuate founder effects during colonisation in a diffusive dispersal model. However, this model yielded too slow a colonisation rate in comparison with palynological data for temperate forest trees. Since rare long-distance dispersal events have been shown to increase considerably colonisation rates in population dynamics models, we investigate here the impact of long-distance dispersal on within-population diversity (H-S) and among-population differentiation (F-ST) during the colonisation process. We use a stochastic approach and compare several dispersal strategies, ranging from very rare dispersal events of large amplitude to more frequent events of smaller amplitude. Using a simulation approach, which takes into account tree life-history traits, we show that long-distance dispersal events increase colonisation speed, and yield much larger founder effects in comparison with the diffusive model. The two models that include intermediate- and long-distance dispersal events show stronger deviations from experimental F-ST values during and at the end of the colonisation process than the model with more frequent events of smaller dispersal variance. Furthermore, the introduction of a high level of pollen flow has a much more limited impact on models that include long-distance dispersal than on a diffusive dispersal model. The relatively high H-S values that were obtained in all models are discussed according to the assumed mutation rate and effective population size. This study is an example of how observed genetic data can provide additional evidence on the best demographic model for a given species or group of species.},

  abstract = {Pollen dispersal is a critical process that shapes genetic diversity in natural populations of plants. Estimating the pollen dispersal curve can provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of populations and is essential background for making predictions about changes induced by perturbations. Specifically, we would like to know whether the dispersal curve is exponential, thin-tailed (decreasing faster than exponential), or fat-tailed (decreasing slower than the exponential). In the latter case, rare events of long-distance dispersal will be much more likely. Here we generalize the previously developed TWOGENER method, assuming that the pollen dispersal curve belongs to particular one- or two-parameter families of dispersal curves and estimating simultaneously the parameters of the dispersal curve and the effective density of reproducing individuals in the population. We tested this method on simulated data, using an exponential power distribution, under thin-tailed, exponential and fat-tailed conditions. We find that even if our estimates show some bias and large mean squared error (MSE), we are able to estimate correctly the general trend of the curve - thin-tailed or fat-tailed - and the effective density. Moreover, the mean distance of dispersal can be correctly estimated with low bias and MSE, even if another family of dispersal curve is used for the estimation. Finally, we consider three case studies based on forest tree species. We find that dispersal is fat-tailed in all cases, and that the effective density estimated by our model is below the measured density in two of the cases. This latter result may reflect the difficulty of estimating two parameters, or it may be a biological consequence of variance in reproductive success of males in the population. Both the simulated and empirical findings demonstrate the strong potential of TWOGENER for evaluating the shape of the dispersal curve and the effective density of the population (d(e)).},

Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Migraine is the second leading cause for disability worldwide and the most common neurological disorder. It is also three times more common in women; reasons for this sex difference are not known. Using preclinical behavioral models of migraine, we show that application of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to the rat dura mater produces cutaneous periorbital hypersensitivity. Surprisingly, this response was observed only in females; dural CGRP at doses from 1 pg to 3.8 {$\mu$}g produce no responses in males. In females, dural CGRP causes priming to a pH 7.0 solution after animals recover from the initial CGRP-induced allodynia. Dural application of interleukin-6 causes acute responses in males and females but only causes priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Intracisternal application of BDNF also causes similar acute hypersensitivity responses in males and females but only priming to subthreshold dural CGRP (0.1 pg) in females. Females were additionally primed to a subthreshold dose of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (0.1 mg/kg) following dural CGRP. Finally, the sexually dimorphic responses to dural CGRP were not specific to rats as similar female-specific hypersensitivity responses were seen in mice, where increased grimace responses were also observed. These data are the first to demonstrate that CGRP-induced headache-like behavioral responses at doses up to 3.8 {$\mu$}g are female-specific both acutely and following central and peripheral priming. These data further implicate dural CGRP signaling in the pathophysiology of migraine and propose a model where dural CGRP-based mechanisms contribute to the sexual disparity of this female-biased disorder.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, and CGRP-based therapeutics are efficacious for the treatment of migraine in humans. However, the location of action for CGRP in migraine remains unclear. We show here that application of CGRP to the cranial meninges causes behavioral responses consistent with headache in preclinical rodent models. Surprisingly, however, these responses are only observed in females. Acute responses to meningeal CGRP are female-specific and sensitization to CGRP after two distinct stimuli are also female-specific. These data implicate the dura mater as a primary location of action for CGRP in migraine and suggest that female-specific mechanisms downstream of CGRP receptor activation contribute to the higher prevalence of migraine in women.},

Many plant pathogenic fungus spores are released into the air from plant surfaces inside plant canopies, where they are produced, or from diseased plant debris on the ground below plant canopies, where they have survived from one growing season to the next. There is no direct way to specify Q for naturally released microscopic fungus spores. It is relatively easy to measure average concentrations of spores above a source, however. A two-dimensional Lagrangian stochastic (LS) simulation model for the motion of spores driven by atmospheric turbulence in and above a plant canopy is presented.

The cost of natural selection expresses the limited capacity of a population to sustain the load of mortality or sterility required for effective selection. Genostasis expresses the lack of variation that prevents many populations from adapting to stress. While the role of relative fitness in adaptation is well understood, evolutionary rescue emphasizes the need to recognize explicitly the importance of absolute fitness. Permanent adaptation requires a range of genetic variation in absolute fitness that is broad enough to provide a few extreme types capable of sustained growth under a stress that would cause extinction if they were not present. This principle implies that population size is an important determinant of rescue. The overall number of individuals exposed to selection will be greater when the population declines gradually under a constant stress, or is progressively challenged by gradually increasing stress. In gradually deteriorating environments, survival at lethal stress may be procured by prior adaptation to sublethal stress through genetic correlation. Neither the standing genetic variation of small populations nor the mutation supply of large populations, however, may be sufficient to provide evolutionary rescue for most populations.},

A transplant experiment in one hillside G. tricolor population examined the roles of competition and soil chemistry as well as litter and biomass accumulation in setting local population boundaries. Results indicate that boundaries are maintained primarily by inhibition of seedling emergence by vegetation and litter, and that upslope and downslope population boundaries are heterogeneous in litter biomass and transplant performance. Consistent emergence inhibition in undisturbed, peripheral sites maintains limits to the distribution of G. tricolor in this population. Fine-scaled ecological heterogeneity and heterogeneous boundary conditions likely play important roles in limiting adaptation and subsequent range expansion at population boundaries in G. tricolor.},

  abstract = {Understanding the consequences of habitat disturbance on mating patterns although pollen and seed dispersal in forest trees has been a long-standing theme of forest and conservation genetics. Forest ecosystems face global environmental pressures from timber exploitation to genetic pollution and climate change, and it is therefore essential to comprehend how disturbances may alter the dispersal of genes and their establishment in tree populations in order to formulate relevant recommendations for sustainable resource management practices and realistic predictions of potential adaptation to climate change by means of range shift or expansion (Kremer et al. 2012). However, obtaining reliable evidence of disturbance-induced effects on gene dispersal processes from empirical evaluation of forest tree populations is difficult. Indeed, tree species share characteristics such as high longevity, long generation time and large reproductive population size, which may impede the experimenter's ability to assess parameters at the spatial and time scales at which any change may occur (Petit and Hampe 2006). It has been suggested that appropriate study designs should encompass comparison of populations before and after disturbance as well as account for demonstrated variation in conspecific density, that is, the spatial distribution of mates, and forest density, including all species and relating to alteration in landscape openness (Bacles \& Jump 2011). However, more often than not, empirical studies aiming to assess the consequences of habitat disturbance on genetic processes in tree populations assume rather than quantify a change in tree densities in forests under disturbance and generally fail to account for population history, which may lead to inappropriate interpretation of a causal relationship between population genetic structure and habitat disturbance due to effects of unmonitored confounding variables (Gauzere et al. 2013). In this issue, Shohami and Nathan (2014) take advantage of the distinctive features of the fire-adapted wind-pollinated Aleppo pine Pinus halepensis (Fig. 1) to provide an elegant example of best practice. Thanks to long-term monitoring of the study site, a natural stand in Israel, Shohami and Nathan witnessed the direct impact of habitat disturbance, here taking the shape of fire, on conspecific and forest densities and compared pre- and postdisturbance mating patterns estimated from cones of different ages sampled on the same surviving maternal individuals (Fig. 2). This excellent study design is all the more strong that Shohami and Nathan took further analytical steps to account for confounding variables, such as historical population genetic structure and possible interannual variation in wind conditions, thus giving high credibility to their findings of unequivocal fire-induced alteration of mating patterns in P. halepensis. Most notably, the authors found, at the pollen pool level, a disruption of local genetic structure which, furthermore, they were able to attribute explicitly to enhanced pollen-mediated gene immigration into the low-density fire-disturbed stand. This cleverly designed research provides a model approach to be followed if we are to advance our understanding of disturbance-induced dispersal and genetic change in forest trees.},

The time period was purposely chosen to encompass the Pollution in the Urban Midlands Atmosphere field campaign. Six natural synoptic scale transport patterns were identified with three, strong-westerly, westerly and slow-easterly, showing seasonal variation in frequency. Significant differences in air pollutant concentrations and behaviour were found between air mass cluster types when they were analysed with measurements taken from an urban background site in Birmingham and a rural site in Harwell. Highest concentrations of primary pollutants were associated with a slow-easterly air mass from mainland Europe, while lowest concentrations were associated with south-westerly and strong-westerly air masses passing over the Atlantic Ocean. The polluted slow-easterly air mass was associated with highest ozone concentration for the warm season and lowest ozone concentration for the cool season. This could be explained by photochemical ozone production during the warm season and NOxtitration of background ozone during the cool season, when photochemically "inactive" conditions prevailed. A wealth of information was determinable, including influences of short and long-range transport and photochemical productivity. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Forty families from each of one Coastal and one Cascade breeding population in Oregon were assessed for cold hardiness and growth phenology, and family means for traits were summarized using principal components analysis (PCA). Composition of the first two principal components (PCs) was consistent between breeding zones, years, and test sites. PC-I, describing 39-46\% of trait variation, represents a suite of traits related to spring phenology and spring cold hardiness. PC-2, describing 20-22\% of trait variation, consists of cold-hardiness traits not associated with phenology. The first two PCs from each population, as well as univariate traits, were regressed on parent tree location variables and modeled climatic indices separately. In the Coastal zone, PC-1 was weakly but significantly related to temperature and moisture regimes (0.176 less than or equal to r(2) less than or equal to 0.235), varying with elevation and distance from the ocean. PC-2 was related to temperature and moisture regimes in both populations (0.087 less than or equal to r(2) less than or equal to 0.249). These relatively weak geographic patterns for adaptive traits within breeding zones suggest that current zone size is not excessive and could likely be increased north or south.},

  abstract = {This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.},

This chapter highlights some of these challenges and provides a definition of landscape genetics. It then presents a simple conceptual framework for landscape genetic analyses, which can be particularly useful for the novice landscape geneticist. Landscape genetics is based on approaches that can be used for quite different purposes. Specifically, there are two major research avenues that are followed in landscape genetics. On the one hand, there are those studies that are interested in understanding how landscape characteristics affect microevolutionary processes. On the other hand, there are those studies that are not interested in genetic variation or microevolution in itself, but rather use genetic data to infer underlying ecological processes, such as dispersal or disease transmission.},

  abstract = {Much of the world's boreal forest occurs on permafrost (perennially cryotic ground). As such, changes in permafrost conditions have implications for forest function and, within the zone of discontinuous permafrost (30-80\% permafrost in areal extent), distribution. Here, forested peat plateaus underlain by permafrost are elevated above the surrounding permafrost-free wetlands; as permafrost thaws, ground surface subsidence leads to waterlogging at forest margins. Within the North American subarctic, recent warming has produced rapid, widespread permafrost thaw and corresponding forest loss. Although permafrost thaw-induced forest loss provides a natural analogue to deforestation occurring in more southerly locations, we know little about how fragmentation relates to subsequent permafrost thaw and forest loss or the role of changing conditions at the edges of forested plateaus. We address these knowledge gaps by (i) examining the relationship of forest loss to the degree of fragmentation in a boreal peatland in the Northwest Territories, Canada; and (ii) quantifying associated biotic and abiotic changes occurring across forest-wetland transitions and extending into the forested plateaus (i.e., edge effects). We demonstrate that the rate of forest loss correlates positively with the degree of fragmentation as quantified by perimeter to area ratio of peat plateaus (edge~:~area). Changes in depth of seasonal thaw, soil moisture, and effective leaf area index (LAIe ) penetrated the plateau forests by 3-15~m. Water uptake by trees was sevenfold greater in the plateau interior than at the edges with direct implications for tree radial growth. A negative relationship existed between LAIe and soil moisture, suggesting that changes in vegetation physiological function may contribute to changing edge conditions while simultaneously being affected by these changes. Enhancing our understanding of mechanisms contributing to differential rates of permafrost thaw and associated forest loss is critical for predicting future interactions between the land surface processes and the climate system in high-latitude regions.},

  abstract = {Global warming is predicted to cause distributional changes in organisms whose geographic ranges are controlled by temperature. We report a recent latitudinal and altitudinal expansion of the pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa, whose larvae build silk nests and feed on pine foliage in the winter. In north-central France (Paris Basin), its range boundary has shifted by 87 km northwards between 1972 and 2004; in northern Italy (Alps), an altitudinal shift of 110-230 m upwards occurred between 1975 and 2004. By experimentally linking winter temperature, feeding activity, and survival of T. pityocampa larvae, we attribute the expansions to increased winter survival due to a warming trend over the past three decades. In the laboratory we determined the minimum nest and night air temperatures required for larval feeding and developed a mechanistic model based on these temperature thresholds. We tested the model in a translocation experiment that employed natural temperature gradients as spatial analogues for global warming. In all transects we transferred colonies of T. pityocampa larvae to sites within zones of historical distribution, recent distribution, and outside the present range. We monitored air and nest temperature, incoming solar radiation, larval phenology, feeding activity, and survival. Early-season temperature effects on phenology were evident, with delayed development of colonies in the more extreme (colder) sites. In the coldest months, our model was consistent with the observed patterns of feeding activity: Feeding was progressively reduced with increasing latitude or elevation, as predicted by the lower number of hours when the feeding threshold was reached, which negatively affected final survival. Insolation raised nest temperature and increased feeding activity on the south but not the north aspect. Prolonged temperature drops below the feeding thresholds occurred at all sites, leading to starvation and partial mortality. Nonetheless, even the most extreme sites still allowed some feeding and, consequently, up to 20\% colony survival and successful pupation. Given that the present distribution of the oligophagous T. pityocampa is not constrained by the disribution of its actual or potential hosts, and that warmer winters will cause the number of hours of feeding to increase and the probability of the lower lethal temperature to decrease, we expect the trend of improved survival in previously prohibitive environments to continue, causing further latitudinal and altitudinal expansion. This work highlights the need to develop temperature-based predictive models for future range shifts of winter-limited species, with potential applications in management.},

One emerging tool for this goal is high-throughput sequencing technology, which can now be used to scan the genome for signs of environmental selection in any species and any system. This explosion of data provides a powerful new window into the molecular mechanisms of adaptation, and although there has been some success in using genomic data to predict responses to selection in fields such as agriculture, thus far genomic data are rarely integrated into predictive frameworks of future adaptation in natural populations. Here, we review both theoretical and empirical studies of adaptation to rapid environmental change, focusing on areas where genomic data are poised to contribute to our ability to estimate species and population persistence and adaptation. We advocate for the need to study and model evolutionary response architectures, which integrate spatial information, fitness estimates, and plasticity with genetic architecture. Understanding how these factors contribute to adaptive responses is essential in efforts to predict the responses of species and ecosystems to future environmental change.},

For the study period of 71 years (1936\textendash{}2006), we found a substantial warming signal, which ranged from an increase of 5.3 degrees Celsius (\textdegree{}C) in the mean monthly temperatures for February to an increase of 1.5\textdegree{}C in those for May. The earliest-blooming species' (Populus tremuloides and Anemone patens) bloom dates advanced by two weeks during the seven decades, whereas the later-blooming species' bloom dates advanced between zero and six days. The early-blooming species' bloom dates advanced faster than was predicted by thermal time models, which we attribute to decreased diurnal temperature fluctuations. This unexpectedly sensitive response results in an increased exposure to late-spring frosts.},

How, if at all, should economists use and combine molecular genetic and economic data from these surveys? What challenges arise when analyzing genetically informative data? To illustrate, we present results from a "genome-wide association study" of educational attainment. We use a sample of 7,500 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study; our dataset contains over 360,000 genetic markers per person. We get some initially promising results linking genetic markers to educational attainment, but these fail to replicate in a second large sample of 9,500 people from the Rotterdam Study. Unfortunately such failure is typical in molecular genetic studies of this type, so the example is also cautionary. We discuss a number of methodological challenges that face researchers who use molecular genetics to reliably identify genetic associates of economic traits. Our overall assessment is cautiously optimistic: this new data source has potential in economics. But researchers and consumers of the genoeconomic literature should be wary of the pitfalls, most notably the difficulty of doing reliable inference when faced with multiple hypothesis problems on a scale never before encountered in social science.},

A fundamental aspect of coevolution is that adaptations and counteradaptations interlace in time. A discordant origin of traits long before or after the origin of the putative coevolutionary selective pressure must be attributed to other evolutionary processes. Despite the importance of this distinction to our understanding of coevolution, the macroevolutionary tempo of innovation in plant defenses and insect counterdefenses has not been documented. Molecular clocks for a lineage of chrysomelid beetles of the genus Blepharida and their Burseraceae hosts were independently calibrated. Results show that these plants' defenses and the insect's counterdefensive feeding traits evolved roughly in synchrony, providing macroevolutionary confirmation of synchronous plant-herbivore coadaptation. The association between these two groups of organisms was determined to be about 112 million years old, the oldest age so far for a specialized plant-herbivore association.},

To determine the impact of these efforts, we evaluated the degree to which ESA membership, governance structures, and awards reflect the diversity of the Society and of the US population as a whole. We collated historical data for the ESA \textendash{} including its governing board, journal editors, section and chapter officers, and award recipients \textendash{} from the Society's websites, issues of the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, and ESA's Publications Office. We examined three periods of recent ESA history, determined by the publication dates of two reports from ESA's Women and Minorities in Ecology (WAMIE) Committee: pre-WAMIE I (the 14-year period between 1979 and 1992), between WAMIE I and II (the 14 years between 1993 and 2006), and post- WAMIE II (the 6-year period from 2007 to 2012). For detailed methods and results, see WebPanel 1. Although the gender and racial composition of the ESA has changed markedly over the past 30 years, it still remains skewed as compared with the overall US population (Figure 1). In the ESA, the percentage of women increased from 23\% to 37\%, and the percentage of underrepresented minorities \textendash{} excluding Asians/Pacific Islanders \textendash{} more than doubled, from 4\% to 9\%. In the same period, US minority populations increased from 21\% to 30\%. Thus, minority populations in the US and in the ESA increased by a factor of 1.4 and 2.5, respectively. While these advances are laudable, minorities remain woefully underrepresented in the ESA.},

No discontinuity in air or water temperature can be correlated with these distributional boundaries. A third species, L. scutulata (Gould, 1849), has the widest range, overlapping with L. planaxis in the south and L. sitkana in the north (Latitude 27.5\textdegree{} to 58\textdegree{}N). L. planaxis transplanted to northern Washington survived for 4 years, grew and produced planktonic larvae. Either larval mortality or south-flowing currents during planktonic life prevent this species from dispersing northward. L. sitkana has direct development and occurs only in habitats where adults are sheltered from waves and egg masses from desiccation. Lack of suitable habitat, coupled with the presence of the predatory crab Pachygrapsus crassipes (Randall, 1839) prevent the southward establishment of L. sitkana.},

  abstract = {We discuss three interlinked issues: the natural pace of environmental change and adaptation, the likelihood that a population will adapt to a potentially lethal change, and adaptation to elevated CO2, the prime mover of global change. 1. Environmental variability is governed by power laws showing that ln differ- ence in conditions increases with ln elapsed time at a rate of 0.3\textendash{}0.4. This leads to strong but fluctuating selection in many natural populations. 2. The effect of repeated adverse change on mean fitness depends on its fre- quency rather than its severity. If the depression of mean fitness leads to population decline, however, severe stress may cause extinction. Evolu- tionary rescue from extinction requires abundant genetic variation or a high mutation supply rate, and thus a large population size. Although natural populations can sustain quite intense selection, they often fail to adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as pollution and acidification and instead become extinct. 3. Experimental selection lines of algae show no specific adaptation to ele- vated CO2, but instead lose their carbon-concentrating mechanism through mutational degradation. This is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the oceanic carbon pump. Elevated CO2 is also likely to lead to changes in phytoplankton community composition, although it is not yet clear what these will be. We emphasize the importance of experimental evolution in understanding and predicting the biological response to global change. This will be one of the main tasks of evolutionary biologists in the coming decade.},

  abstract = {Neutral and functional theories provide rival interpretations of community patterns involving distribution, abundance, and diversity. One group of patterns describes the overall properties of species or sites, and derives principally from the frequency distribution of abundance among species. According to neutral theory, these patterns are determined by the number of individuals of novel type appearing each generation in the community, whereas functional theory relates them to the distribution of the extent of niches. A second group of patterns describes the spatial attributes of communities, and derives principally from the decay of similarity in species composition with distance. Neutral theory interprets these patterns as consequences of local dispersal alone, whereas the functional interpretation is that more distant sites are likely to be ecologically different. Neutral theory often provides good predictions of community patterns, yet is at variance with a wide range of experimental results involving the manipulation of environments or communities. One explanation for this discrepancy is that spatially explicit models where selection is generally weak, or where selection acts strongly on only a few species at each site, have essentially the same output as neutral models with respect to the distribution of abundance and the decay of similarity. Detecting a non-neutral signal in survey data requires careful spatial or phylogenetic analysis; we emphasize the potential utility of incorporating phylogenetic information in order to detect functional processes that lead to ecological variation among clades.},

  abstract = {Heritable genetic variation is necessary for populations to evolve in response to anthropogenic climate change. However, antagonistic genetic correlations among traits may constrain the rate of adaptation, even if substantial genetic variation exists. We examine potential genetic responses to selection by comparing multivariate genetic variance-covariances of traits and fitness (multivariate Robertson-Price identities) across different environments in a reciprocal transplant experiment of the forb Boechera stricta in the Rocky Mountains. By transplanting populations into four common gardens arrayed along an elevational gradient, and exposing populations to control and snow removal treatments, we simulated future and current climates and snowmelt regimes. Genetic variation in flowering and germination phenology declined in plants moved downslope to warmer, drier sites, suggesting that these traits may have a limited ability to evolve under future climates. Simulated climate change via snow removal altered the strength of selection on flowering traits, but we found little evidence that genetic correlations among traits are likely to affect the rate of adaptation to climate change. Overall, our results suggest that climate change may alter the evolutionary potential of B. stricta, but reduced expression of genetic variation may be a larger impediment to adaptation than constraints imposed by antagonistic genetic correlations.

Climate-based models identify only broad areas of potential habitat, traditional phylogeographic studies provide poor spatial resolution, and pollen records for temperate forest communities are difficult to interpret and do not provide species-level taxonomic resolution. Here we harness signals of range expansion from large genomic datasets, using a simulation-based framework to infer the precise latitude and longitude of glacial refugia in two widespread, codistributed hickories (Carya spp.) and to quantify uncertainty in these estimates. We show that one species likely expanded from close to ice sheet margins near the site of a previously described macrofossil for the genus, highlighting support for the controversial notion of northern microrefugia. In contrast, the expansion origin inferred for the second species is compatible with classic hypotheses of distant displacement into southern refugia. Our statistically rigorous, powerful approach demonstrates how refugia can be located from genomic data with high precision and accuracy, addressing fundamental questions about long-term responses to changing climates and providing statistical insight into longstanding questions that have previously been addressed primarily qualitatively.},

of this conceptual paper is to provide readers with an opportunity to reassess

The approach of the paper is to analyse recent studies on climate change and
its implications 
for our ecosystems, economies and societies, as provided by academic journals and 
publications direct from research institutes. 
That synthesis leads to a conclusion there will be a near term collapse in society with serious 
ramification
s for the lives of readers. The paper reviews some of the reasons why collapse
-
denial may exist, in particular, in the professions of sustainability research and practice, 
therefore leading to these arguments having been absent from these fields until now.
The paper offers a new meta

framing of the implications for research, organisational practice, 
personal development and public policy, called the Deep Adaptation Agenda. Its key aspects 
of resilience, relinquishment and restorations are explained. This a
genda does not seek to 
build on existing scholarship on ``climate adaptation'' as it is premised on the view that social 
collapse is now inevitable. 
The author believes this is one of the first papers in the sustainability management field to 
conclude that climate

However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long-term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15-30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long-term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.},

  abstract = {A genetic analysis of the introgression zone between Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and white spruce (P. glauca) in northwestern British Columbia was conducted to (1) quantify the contributions of parental species to introgressed populations; (2) characterize genetic patterns of variation across the introgression zone; and (3) address practical issues of gene resource management in this region. Seeds were sampled and seedlings grown from 57 putative hybrid parent trees from 16 locations across the introgression zone. Foliage samples were also obtained for allopatric Sitka and white spruce reference populations. Based on allele frequencies for sequence-tagged-site (STS) molecular markers, a hybrid index was developed that reflects the relative contribution of Sitka spruce to hybrid populations (0=white spruce, 1=Sitka spruce). Mean STS hybrid index estimates ranged from 0.46 to 0.95 for locations within the zone of introgression. Significant differences in hybrid index were observed among sampling locations. Hybrid indices decreased from the coast to the interior within the introgression zone in spite of large among-family variation within locations. Variation among locations in hybrid index was better explained by geographic variables than by climatic or ecological variables. Physical drainage distance along river valleys to the nearest marine inlet explained 78\% of the variation in STS hybrid index. Concordant clines were obtained when the same analytical techniques were applied to published allozyme frequencies for seedlots originating from a wider geographic area across the introgression zone. Allozyme hybrid index estimates ranged from 0.01 to 0.98. The relatively steep cline observed in hybrid index across the maritime/continental climate ecotone is best managed by limiting longitudinal seed transfer for reforestation in this region. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In recent decades, there has been a call for change among all stakeholders involved in scoliosis management. Parents of children with scoliosis have complained about the so-called ``wait and see'' approach that far too many doctors use when evaluating children's scoliosis curves between 10\textdegree{} and 25\textdegree. Observation, Physiotherapy Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSE) and bracing for idiopathic scoliosis during growth are all therapeutic interventions accepted by the 2011 International Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT). The standard features of these interventions are: 1) 3-dimension self-correction; 2) Training activities of daily living (ADL); and 3) Stabilization of the corrected posture. PSSE is part of a scoliosis care model that includes scoliosis specific education, scoliosis specific physical therapy exercises, observation or surveillance, psychological support and intervention, bracing and surgery. The model is oriented to the patient. Diagnosis and patient evaluation is essential in this model looking at a patient-oriented decision according to clinical experience, scientific evidence and patient's preference. Thus, specific exercises are not considered as an alternative to bracing or surgery but as a therapeutic intervention, which can be used alone or in combination with bracing or surgery according to individual indication. In the PSSE model it is recommended that the physical therapist work as part of a multidisciplinary team including the orthopeadic doctor, the orthotist, and the mental health care provider - all are according to the SOSORT guidelines and Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) philosophy. From clinical experiences, PSSE can temporarily stabilize progressive scoliosis curves during the secondary period of progression, more than a year after passing the peak of growth. In non-progressive scoliosis, the regular practice of PSSE could produce a temporary and significant reduction of the Cobb angle. PSSE can also produce benefits in subjects with scoliosis other than reducing the Cobb angle, like improving back asymmetry, based on 3D self-correction and stabilization of a stable 3D corrected posture, as well as the secondary muscle imbalance and related pain. In more severe cases of thoracic scoliosis, it can also improve breathing function., This paper will discuss in detail seven major scoliosis schools and their approaches to PSSE, including their bracing techniques and scientific evidence. The aim of this paper is to understand and learn about the different international treatment methods so that physical therapists can incorporate the best from each into their own practices, and in that way attempt to improve the conservative management of patients with idiopathic scoliosis. These schools are presented in the historical order in which they were developed. They include the Lyon approach from France, the Katharina Schroth Asklepios approach from Germany, the Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS) from Italy, the Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School approach (BSPTS) from Spain, the Dobomed approach from Poland, the Side Shift approach from the United Kingdom, and the Functional Individual Therapy of Scoliosis approach (FITS) from Poland.},

Let the patch be inhabited by a population of individuals that reproduce, disperse, and die. Will the population persist? How does the answer depend on the length of the patch, the speed of movement of the patch, the net population growth rate under constant conditions, and the mobility of the individuals? We will answer these questions in the context of a simple dynamic profile model that incorporates climate shift, population dynamics, and migration. The model takes the form of a growth-diffusion equation. We first consider a special case and derive an explicit condition by glueing phase portraits. Then we establish a strict qualitative dichotomy for a large class of models by way of rigorous PDE methods, in particular the maximum principle. The results show that mobility can both reduce and enhance the ability to track climate change that a narrow range can severely reduce this ability and that population range and total population size can both increase and decrease under a moving climate. It is also shown that range shift may be easier to detect at the expanding front, simply because it is considerably steeper than the retreating back.},

We contrast patterns of clinal variation in these continents with patterns of differentiation among ancestral European and African populations. We show that recently derived North America and Australia populations were likely founded by both European and African lineages and that this admixture event generated genomewide patterns of parallel clinal variation. The pervasive effects of admixture meant that only a handful of loci could be attributed to the operation of spatially varying selection using an FST outlier approach. Our results provide novel insight into a well-studied system of clinal differentiation and provide a context for future studies seeking to identify loci contributing to local adaptation in D. melanogaster.},

A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

Four communities in the study area were surveyed and 8053 point locations were mapped for 10 different value types. Importance weights of landscape values were determined through a ranking exercise. Nearest-neighbour and second-order spatial point pattern analysis (K functions) suggested that all value types were significantly clustered across the study area. Recreational, wilderness, existence, and biological diversity values exhibited maximum clustering at larger spatial scales in comparison with educational, economic, historic or cultural, and spiritual values. Maximum clustering was positively related to mean road density and negatively related to mean distance to water, which suggests that landscape features influence the spatial pattern of values by acting as focal points or attractors for values.

In situ hemlock macrofossils and insect remains found in a paludified dunefield at the northern limit of hemlock testify that two defoliation events occurred at 4910 {$\pm$} 90 and 4200 {$\pm$} 100 yr B.P., respectively. The sharp coincidence of remains from hemlock needles with chewing damage typical of hemlock looper feeding, head capsules from the hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria) and the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), absence of hemlock fruiting remains, and tree-ring anomalies in fossil hemlocks that died prematurely ({$<$}165 yr) suggest that defoliation affected hemlock reproductive capacity and pollen productivity, or more likely caused mass mortality. Our findings indicate that defoliation can affect ecosystems for centuries, especially when long-lived tree species are involved. \textcopyright{} 1996 University of Washington.},

  abstract = {In ecology textbooks prior to the 1970s, Aldo Leopold's classic story of predator control, over- population of deer, and habitat degradation on the Kaibab Plateau during the 1920s epitomized pred- ator regulation of herbivore populations. However, the story disappeared from texts in the late 20th century after several papers noted uncertainties in estimations of the deer population and provided alternative explanations. We re-examined the case study by determining the age structure of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) on the plateau. Aspen comprises the majority of deer browse in the summer, and the absence of a normal cohort of aspen from the 1920s would indicate deer over- population. The number of aspen (at 1.4 m) dating to the 1920s was an order of magnitude lower than the null expectation. Other periods of unusual numbers of aspen included high numbers of aspen dating to the 1880s and 1890s (when regular surface fires ceased), few aspen dating from 1953 to 1962 (after a second irruption of the deer popula- tion), and very high numbers from 1968 to 1992 (coincident with widespread logging). These con- vergent lines of evidence support the idea of ex- treme deer herbivory in the 1920s, consistent with food limitation of deer at high populations (bot- tom\textendash{}up control) and predation limitation at low deer populations (top\textendash{}down control). Some uncertainty remains within the overall story, and this level of ambiguity is common in case studies that involve population ecology, land manage- ment, and people at the scale of 1,000 km2 and 100 years. A complete version of the Kaibab deer story and its history would be a valuable, realistic case study for ecology texts.},

Craspedolepta nebulosa extended to higher elevations than C. subpunctata but within their ranges neither species showed a clear altitudinal trend in abundance per plant. However, the former species grew to a smaller size with increasing elevation. 4. There was little evidence for interspecific competitive effects and observed levels of parasitism and predation were negligible across the transect. 5. Development and distribution of both species mirrored significant differences in the phenology, size, leaf number, and reproductive output of E. angustifolium with increasing altitude. 6. Distributions were related to available heat budgets acting on psyllid/plant development rates, with C. nebulosa developing more efficiently at lower heat availability. 7. Population transplant experiments supported the overall conclusions, with neither psyllid species able to establish viable populations above their current upper altitudinal range limit, despite the presence of their host plant.},

We find that both density and relatedness in the release patch increase dispersal distance. Relatedness, but not density, changes the shape of the dispersal kernel towards a more skewed and leptokurtic shape including a longer 'fat-tail'. This is the first experimental demonstration that kin competition can shape the whole distribution of dispersal distances in a population, and thus affect the geographical spread of dispersal phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Recent changes in climate have led to significant shifts in phenology, with many studies demonstrating advanced phenology in response to warming temperatures. The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21~years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1~\textdegree{}C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2~days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.},

  abstract = {Background Real science has the potential to not only amaze, but also transform the way one thinks of the world and oneself. This is because the process of science is little different from the deeply resonant, natural processes of play. Play enables humans (and other mammals) to discover (and create) relationships and patterns. When one adds rules to play, a game is created. This is science: the process of playing with rules that enables one to reveal previously unseen patterns of relationships that extend our collective understanding of nature and human nature. When thought of in this way, science education becomes a more enlightened and intuitive process of asking questions and devising games to address those questions. But, because the outcome of all game-playing is unpredictable, supporting this `messyness', which is the engine of science, is critical to good science education (and indeed creative education generally). Indeed, we have learned that doing `real' science in public spaces can stimulate tremendous interest in children and adults in understanding the processes by which we make sense of the world. The present study (on the vision of bumble-bees) goes even further, since it was not only performed outside my laboratory (in a Norman church in the southwest of England), but the `games' were themselves devised in collaboration with 25 8- to 10-year-old children. They asked the questions, hypothesized the answers, designed the games (in other words, the experiments) to test these hypotheses and analysed the data. They also drew the figures (in coloured pencil) and wrote the paper. Their headteacher (Dave Strudwick) and I devised the educational programme (we call `i,scientist'), and I trained the bees and transcribed the childrens' words into text (which was done with smaller groups of children at the school's local village pub). So what follows is a novel study (scientifically and conceptually) in `kids speak' without references to past literature, which is a challenge. Although the historical context of any study is of course important, including references in this instance would be disingenuous for two reasons. First, given the way scientific data are naturally reported, the relevant information is simply inaccessible to the literate ability of 8- to 10-year-old children, and second, the true motivation for any scientific study (at least one of integrity) is one's own curiousity, which for the children was not inspired by the scientific literature, but their own observations of the world. This lack of historical, scientific context does not diminish the resulting data, scientific methodology or merit of the discovery for the scientific and `non-scientific' audience. On the contrary, it reveals science in its truest (most naive) form, and in this way makes explicit the commonality between science, art and indeed all creative activities.\textbackslash{}nPrincipal finding `We discovered that bumble-bees can use a combination of colour and spatial relationships in deciding which colour of flower to forage from. We also discovered that science is cool and fun because you get to do stuff that no one has ever done before. (Children from Blackawton)'.},

Our goals were to determine whether ecosystem-specific, intraannual, and interactive responses to altered precipitation and warming are quantitatively important. Passive collectors and interceptors increased (+50\% per event) and reduced (-30\% per event) the quantity of precipitation delivered to experimental plant-soil mesocosms, and downward transfer along the elevation gradient warmed mesocosms by 1.8A degrees C on average. Methane uptake in the colder and wetter ecosystems along the gradient decreased with increasing precipitation, especially during the wet season. The warmer and drier ecosystems, however, responded more strongly to warming, exhibiting less CH4 uptake with increasing temperature. We found no interaction between altered precipitation and warming in any ecosystem. Soil CH4 consumption in the laboratory was a strong predictor of ecosystem differences in field CH4 consumption, but was a poor predictor of the effects of climatic change observed in the field. Based on our results, future climate scenarios that are wet and warm will cause the largest reduction in terrestrial CH4 uptake across ecosystem types.},

To identify possible dynamics of species when including these factors, we ran simulations of two competing species using an individual-based, coupled map-lattice model using a linear climatic gradient that varies across latitude and is warmed over time. Reproductive success is governed by an individual's adaptation to local climate as well as its location relative to global constraints. In exploratory experiments varying the strength of adaptation and competition, competition reduces genetic diversity and slows range change, although the two species can coexist in the absence of climate change and shift in the absence of competitors. We also found that one species can drive the other to extinction, sometimes long after climate change ends. Weak selection on local adaptation and poor dispersal ability also caused surfing of cooler-adapted phenotypes from the expanding margin backwards, causing loss of warmer-adapted phenotypes. Finally, geographic ranges can become disjointed, losing centrally-adapted genotypes. These initial results suggest that the interplay between local adaptation and interspecific competition can significantly influence species' responses to climate change, in a way that demands future research.},

  abstract = {Masting, the highly variable production of synchronized large seed crops, is a common reproductive strategy in plant populations. In wind-pollinated trees, flowering and pollination dynamics are hypothesized to provide the mechanistic link for the well-known relationship between weather and population-level seed production. Several hypotheses make predictions about the effect of weather on annual pollination success. The pollen coupling hypothesis predicts that weather and plant resources drive the flowering effort of trees which directly translates into the size of seed crops through efficient pollination. In contrast, the pollination Moran effect hypothesis predicts that weather affects pollination efficiency, leading to occasional bumper crops. Furthermore, the recently formulated phenology synchrony hypothesis predicts that Moran effects can arise because of weather effects on flowering synchrony, which, in turn, drives pollination efficiency. We investigated the relationship between weather, airborne pollen, and seed production in common European trees, two oak species (Quercus petraea and Q. robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) with a 19-year data set from three sites in Poland. Our results show that warm summers preceding flowering correlated with high pollen abundance and warm springs resulted in short pollen seasons (i.e. high flowering synchrony) for all three species. Pollen abundance was the best predictor for seed crops in beech, as predicted under pollen coupling. In oaks, short pollen seasons, rather than pollen abundance, correlated with large seed crops, providing support for the pollination Moran effect and phenology synchrony hypotheses. Fundamentally different mechanisms may therefore drive masting in species of the family Fagacae.},

However, no study has tested its effects using a realistic dispersal kernel in a metapopulation context with explicit spatial structure and local extinctions. 2 We incorporated such kernels into a newly proposed simulation model, which combines within-patch (population) demographic processes and a simplified maternally inherited single-locus, two-allele genetic make-up of  the populations. As a test case, we modelled a typical conservation scenario of  Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) populations. 3 The effects of  LDD were rather diverse and depended on initial population conditions and local extinction rates. LDD increased metapopulation survival at intermediate local-extinction probabilities. LDD helped maintain higher total genetic variability in populations that were initially drifted, but facilitated random genetic loss through drift in initially `well mixed' populations. LDD prevented population differentiation in low extinction rates but increased it at intermediate to high extinction rates. 4 Our results suggest that LDD has broader evolutionary implications and would be selected for in populations facing intermediate local-extinction pressures. Our modelling approach provides a strong tool to test the effects of  LDD on metapopulation survival and genetic variability and to identify the parameters to which such effects are most sensitive, in ecological and conservational scenarios.},

  abstract = {Pollen of forest trees can move on the scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers, but the question of its viability during this long distance dispersal (LDD) has yet to be answered. While empirical studies of pollen viability in forest tree species are rare, controlled and scalable data to outdoor studies of the contribution of UV irradiation on pollen viability are not available. A simple protocol that allows the quantification of the viability response of pollen to UV, temperature, and humidity is developed and described here. Bench-scale conditions that approximate a wide range of atmospheric conditions including different humidity, temperature, and UV irradiation condition are used to determine the independent effects of each abiotic stress factor, and empirical functions are fitted and used to scale these bench-scale experiments to outdoor conditions. As a case study, pollen was sampled from two populations of Pinus taeda during two years and was used to quantify the decrease in viability due to atmospheric conditions during LDD. Contrary to maize pollen, P. taeda pollen viability decreased due to humid and cold conditions. The viability response of pollen to UV-A and UV-B corresponded to a viability reduction of about 10\% after a full day of exposure. These laboratory findings were corroborated by an outdoor solar exposure experiment. The Fu-Liou online radiation model and a data set of radiosonde observations were used to estimate the typical conditions that would be encountered by LDD pollen. If initially caught in a strong updraft, dispersing P. taeda pollen could be carried many days and thousands of kilometers in the air. The empirical equations for P. taeda pollen viability reduction due to abiotic stresses predicted that 50\% of the pollen would survive 24 hours of LDD under typical external conditions. The viable range of the pollen is, therefore, shorter than the physical dispersal distance. The methods used in our experiments are applicable for determination of dispersing pollen viability, especially when effects of different adverse conditions need to be separated. The empirical viability equations that resulted from our experiments can be used in an atmospheric dispersal model to estimate the viable range of tree pollen.},

The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

  abstract = {Most North American forests are at some stage of post-disturbance regrowth, subject to a changing climate, and exhibit growth and mortality patterns that may not be closely coupled to annual environmental conditions. Distinguishing the possibly interacting effects of these processes is necessary to put short-term studies in a longer term context, and particularly important for the carbon-dense, fire-prone boreal forest. The goals of this study were to combine dendrochronological sampling, inventory records, and machine-learning algorithms to understand how tree growth and death have changed at one highly studied site (Northern Old Black Spruce, NOBS) in the central Canadian boreal forest. Over the 1999-2012 inventory period, mean tree diameter increased even as stand density and basal area declined significantly. Tree mortality averaged 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.6\% yr-(1), with most mortality occurring in medium-sized trees; new recruitment was minimal. There have been at least two, and probably three, significant influxes of new trees since stand initiation, but none in recent decades. A combined tree ring chronology constructed from sampling in 2001, 2004, and 2012 showed several periods of extreme growth depression, with increased mortality lagging depressed growth by \textasciitilde{}5 years. Higher minimum and maximum air temperatures exerted a negative influence on tree growth, while precipitation and climate moisture index had a positive effect; both current- and previous-year data exerted significant effects. Models based on these variables explained 23-44\% of the ring-width variability. We suggest that past climate extremes led to significant mortality still visible in the current forest structure, with decadal dynamics superimposed on slower patterns of fire and succession. These results have significant implications for our understanding of previous work at NOBS, the carbon sequestration capability of old-growth stands in a disturbance-prone landscape, and the sustainable management of regional forests in a changing climate.},

The idea that flammability has evolved in many fire-prone communities has been criticised for being group-selectionist. However flammability may enhance inclusive fitness if the resulting fires kill neighbouring less flammable individuals and also open recruitment possibilities. We modelled the evolution of flammability using cellular automata to simulate neighbourhood effects of burning. For plants that survive fire only from unburt canopies (non-sprouters), increased flammability would cause them to bur to death. Flammability traits can evolve in such species only if they result in fire spreading to kill less flammable neighbours and only if they carry additional fitness benefits. In species that resprout from roots or stem bases after fire, flammability can evolve merely by increasing neighbour mortality but is more likely to do so if the associated traits had other benefits. Most flammability-enhancing traits, both structural and biochemical, are likely to have such additional benefits. We predict that flammabil-ity traits will be associated with dense populations where the effect on neighbours is most marked and suggest several tests. Fire has been a key, but neglected, evolutionary force. Alteration of the fire regime through the evolution of flammability, even in a single species contributing heavily to fuel loads, would result in the selective exclusion or admission of other species to an ecosystem depending on the compatibility of their pre-existing traits with fire. Many vegetation types depend on fire for their continued persistence. Without fire, these communities are replaced by non-flammable forests and scrub. Mutch (1970) ar-gued that fire-prone vegetation may have evolved charac-teristics which increase flammability and thereby contrib-ute to the perpetuation of fire-dependent communities. He argued that though ignition may occur "accidentally or randomly, the character of burning is not random. ... Fire dependent plant communities bum more readily than non-fire-dependent communities because natural selec-tion has favoured development of characteristics that make them more flammable". Mutch's hypothesis has been widely cited by fire ecol-ogists since it seems to provide an evolutionary rationale for the differences between fire-prone and fire-free},

Levels of gene flow between populations vary not only with distance, but also with divergence in reproductive phenology. Since phenology is often locally adapted, arriving migrants may be reproductively out of synch with residents, which can depress realized gene flow. In flowering plants, the potential impact of phenological divergence on hybridization between populations can be predicted from overlap in flowering schedules\textemdash{}the daily count of flowers capable of pollen exchange\textemdash{}between a resident and migrant population. The accuracy of this prospective hybridization estimate, based on parental phenotypes, rests upon the assumptions of unbiased pollen transfer between resident and migrant active flowers. We tested the impact of phenological divergence on resident\textendash{}migrant mating frequencies in experiments that mimicked a single large gene flow event. We first prospectively estimated mating frequencies two lines of Brassica rapa selected or early and late flowering. We then estimated realized mating frequencies retrospectively through progeny testing. The two estimates strongly agreed in a greenhouse experiment, where procedures ensured saturating, unbiased pollination. Under natural pollination in the field, the rate of resident\textendash{}migrant mating, was lower than estimated by phenological divergence alone, although prospective and retrospective estimates were correlated. In both experiments, differences between residents and migrants in flowering schedule shape led to asymmetric hybridization. Results suggest that a prospective estimate of hybridization based on mating schedules can be a useful, although imperfect, tool for evaluating potential gene flow. They also illustrate the impact of mating phenology on the magnitude and symmetry of reproductive isolation.},

For that reason, outliers in the genome wide distribution of summary statistics measuring genetic differentiation, such as FST, are often interpreted as evidence for alleles which contribute to local adaptation. However, in spatially structured populations, the spread of beneficial mutations with spatially uniform effects can also induce transient genetic differentiation and numerous theoretical studies have suggested that species-wide, or global, adaptation makes a substantial contribution to molecular evolution. In this study, we ask whether such global adaptation affects the genome-wide distribution of FST and generates statistical outliers which could be mistaken for local adaptation. Using forward-in-time population genetic simulations assuming parameters for the rate and strength of beneficial mutations similar to those that have been estimated for natural populations, we show the spread of globally beneficial in parapatric populations can readily generate FST outliers, which may be misinterpreted as evidence for local adaptation. The spread of beneficial mutations causes selective sweeps at flanking sites, so the effects of global versus local adaptation may be distinguished by examining patterns of nucleotide diversity along with FST. Our study suggests that global adaptation should be considered in the interpretation of genome-scan results and the design of future studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of local adaptation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

High throughput sequencing technologies now offer unprecedented power to explore these interactions, allowing powerful inferences about historical processes of colonization, gene flow and divergence, as well as the identification of loci that mediate local adaptation. These 'landscape genomic' approaches have been validated in model species and are now being applied to nonmodel organisms, including foundation species that have substantial effects on ecosystem processes. Here we review the growing field of landscape genomics from a very broad perspective. In particular, we describe the inferential power that is gained by taking a genome-wide view of genetic variation, strategies for study design to best capture adaptive variation, and how to apply this information to practical challenges, such as restoration.},

There is observational and modelling evidence that an increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 would suppress the evapotranspiration (ET) rate over land. This process is known as CO2 physiological forcing and has been shown to induce changes in surface temperature and continental runoff. We analyse two transient climate simulations for the twenty-first century to isolate the climate response to the CO2 physiological forcing. The land surface warming associated with the decreased ET rate is accompanied by an increase in the atmospheric lapse rate, an increase in specific humidity, but a decrease in relative humidity and stratiform cloud over land. We find that the water vapour feedback more than compensates for the decrease in latent heat flux over land as far as the budget of atmospheric water vapour is concerned. There is evidence that surface snow, water vapour and cloudiness respond to the CO2 physiological forcing and all contribute to further warm the climate system. The climate response to the CO2 physiological forcing has a quite different signature to that from the CO2 radiative forcing, especially in terms of the changes in the temperature vertical profile and surface energy budget over land.},

  abstract = {The pollen content of 77 snow samples, collected at 41 sites in the Canadian Arctic, the adjacent Arctic Ocean and Greenland can be used to identify source regions that produced the assemblages. The major vegetation zones of northern Canada produce distinctive pollen assemblages, and principal components analysis (PCA) indicate that these assemblages are retained even in snow on the sea ice surface. It is shown that pollen percentages and concentrations are related to the density of the regional vegetation and to the distance to the source of more productive regions. Because the pollen grains may be transported for great distances (even to the central regions of the Arctic Ocean), they may be used to indicate the source of that pollen and the trajectory of the air masses that carried and deposited them. Pine is particularly valuable in this sense because it has longer trajectories than other tree pollen. For example, there are indications of "over-the-pole" transport of pollen from higher pine pollen concentrations at the North Pole than on northern Ellesmere Island. Pollen concentrations of certain taxa change significantly at similar to 75 degreesN, north of which the concentrations become lower, thereby suggesting that there is a climatic boundary at that latitude. Therefore it would appear that studies of the concentration of pollen in snow have the potential for determining past and present characteristics of atmospheric circulation and also for helping in the development and interpretation of paleoenvironmental records in regions without vegetation, such as ice caps.},

  abstract = {In the two decades since the 1992 Rio Conference, land-use planning (LUP) has become recognized as a key instrument in putting discourses on sustainable development into practice. In Lao PDR, despite the implementation problems, it is still seen as a lever for securing land tenure, rationalizing extension services provision, and more recently, for implementing `Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD) schemes. Impact assessments of past LUP have revealed weaknesses of local institutions in the effective implementation of land policies. In order to avoid the blind trust placed in delusive LUP success stories, methods for monitoring community participation and understanding of LUP activities have been developed in order to assess the quality of the process. Expanding on this perspective, this article proposes a method to assess the quality of LUP outputs and to visualize the gap between planning objectives and their actual achievements. This method, based on a refined analysis of past and present land zoning practices in Lao PDR, gives full prominence to the complexity of landscape mosaics and the way local populations actually use the land. Furthermore, this approach, developed and tested under real planning conditions, can also be seen as a safeguard and support for inexperienced implementers in their land-use planning practices, as a diagnostic instrument for quality assessment, i.e. level of accuracy of a land-use plan, and may finally pave the way toward becoming a tool for land-use planning certification.},

Testing across all seasons was used to determine the annual pattern of cold hardiness, and more intensive sampling in the fall and spring was used to assess genetic variation in cold injury among geographic regions spanning the range of the species. Mean hardiness varied widely from \textendash{}9 \textdegree{}C in early summer to below \textendash{}70 \textdegree{}C in the winter. Trees from interior and northern regions were the most hardy in the fall, while trees from California were the least hardy. Geographic patterns of hardiness in the spring were reversed. Significant differences in cold injury among regions were detected on all dates except during the winter. Heritability was low to moderate for both the spring (h2 = 0.18) and the fall (h2 = 0.28), and genetic correlation was weak (rA = 0.18). Only spring cold injury was genetically correlated with date of needle flush (rA = 0.34). Mean cold injury in the fall was most closely correlated with mean temperature of the coldest month in the parental environment (r = 0.81). Whitebark pine is well adapted to the low temperatures of the harsh environments where it is found; however, regional variation indicates that moving seed for restoration purposes from areas with higher winter temperatures to colder environments may increase the chance of fall cold injury.},

Restoration is needed; however, no information regarding the degree of local adaptation is available to guide these efforts. A seedling common-garden experiment was employed to assess genetic diversity and geographic differentiation (Q(ST)) of whitebark pine for traits involved in growth and adaptation to cold and to determine climatic variables revealing local adaptation. Seedlings from 48 populations were grown for two years and measured for height increment, biomass, root to shoot ratio, date of needle flush, fall and spring cold injury, and survival. Significant variation was observed among populations for most traits. The Q(ST) was low (0.07-0.14) for growth traits and moderate (0.36-0.47) for cold adaptation related traits, but varied by region. Cold adaptation traits were strongly correlated with mean temperature of the coldest month of population origins, while growth traits were generally correlated with growing season length. We recommend that seed transfer for restoration favor seed movement from milder to colder climates to a maximum of 1.9\textdegree{}C in mean annual temperature in the northern portion of the species range, and 1.0\textdegree{}C in the U. S. Rocky Mountains to avoid maladaptation to current conditions yet facilitate adaptation to future climates.},

Seeds received a standard 1 month of warm moist treatment and 2 months of cold stratification treatment and germination regime, and germination capacity was determined for 100 viable seeds per family. A subset of families received an additional 6 months of cold stratification. Mean germination was 13.4\% after 2 months of cold stratification and 76.6\% after an additional 6 months of cold stratification, with a wide range among seedlots for both assessments. The length of storage did not affect germination significantly in the first test, but it was associated with a decline in the second test. Germination capacity of up to 80\% was achieved with seeds that had been in storage for 10 years. High viability of stored seeds indicate that ex situ seed storage should provide a viable means of conserving genetic resources; however, we recommend that standard protocols for germination of whitebark pine seeds be modified by extending the cold stratification period.},

One common theme that arose during the meeting is the need for improved access to the output products of forecast models and reanalysis systems, which are used as in-puts to trajectory and dispersion models. The steady increases in horizontal and vertical resolution in forecast models and data assimilation systems have not been accompanied by changes in model output products, such as higher-frequency winds and the provision of important auxiliary parameters (e.g., heating rates and subgrid-scale mixing properties).

  abstract = {Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use genome-wide polymorphism data to build ``geogenetic maps'', which, when applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary biologists tend to approach the study of the natural world within a framework of adaptation, inspired perhaps by the power of natural selection to produce fitness advantages that drive population persistence and biological diversity. In contrast, evolution has rarely been studied through the lens of adaptation's complement, maladaptation. This contrast is surprising because maladaptation is a prevalent feature of evolution: population trait values are rarely distributed optimally; local populations often have lower fitness than imported ones; populations decline; and local and global extinctions are common. Yet we lack a general framework for understanding maladaptation; for instance in terms of distribution, severity, and dynamics. Similar uncertainties apply to the causes of maladaptation. We suggest that incorporating maladaptation-based perspectives into evolutionary biology would facilitate better understanding of the natural world. Approaches within a maladaptation framework might be especially profitable in applied evolution contexts \textendash{} where reductions in fitness are common. Toward advancing a more balanced study of evolution, here we present a conceptual framework describing causes of maladaptation. As the introductory article for a Special Feature on maladaptation, we also summarize the studies in this Issue, highlighting the causes of maladaptation in each study. We hope that our framework and the papers in this Special Issue will help catalyze the study of maladaptation in applied evolution, supporting greater understanding of evolutionary dynamics in our rapidly changing world.},

Non-parametric statistics are then used to test for 'significant' differences in the chemical composition of pollutant data associated with each cluster. Additional information about the spatial and temporal scales of pollutant transport is obtained from the time-lagged inter-site correlation analysis of ozone for a specific cluster. To illustrate the application of this methodology, we examined 5 yr long time-series data of ozone concentrations measured at Whiteface Mountain, NY, Cliffside Park, NJ, and Quabbin Summit, MA. The results provide evidence of ozone transport to these sites, revealing the spatial and temporal scales involved in the transport.},

Of particular concern is regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which rapidly alters ecosystem type, associated ecosystem properties, and land surface conditions for decades. Here, we quantify regional-scale vegetation die-off across southwestern North American woodlands in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated bark beetle infestations. At an intensively studied site within the region, we quantified that after 15 months of depleted soil water content, {$>$}90\% of the dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis, a pi{\~n}on) died. The die-off was reflected in changes in a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), not only at the intensively studied site but also across the region, extending over 12,000 km2 or more; aerial and field surveys confirmed the general extent of the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer than the previous subcontinental drought of the 1950s. The limited, available observations suggest that die-off from the recent drought was more extensive than that from the previous drought, extending into wetter sites within the tree species' distribution. Our results quantify a trigger leading to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody plants at subcontinental scale and highlight the potential for such die-off to be more severe and extensive for future global-change-type drought under warmer conditions.},

Here, we document plant water stress in two widely distributed, co-occurring species, pi{\~n}on pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma), over more than a decade, leading up to regional-scale die-off of pi{\~n}on pine trees in response to global change-related drought. Pi{\~n}on leaf water potentials remained substantially below their zero carbon assimilation point for at least 10 months prior to dying, in contrast to those of juniper, which rarely dropped below their zero-assimilation point. These data suggest that pi{\~n}on mortality was driven by protracted water stress, leading to carbon starvation and associated increases in susceptibility to other disturbances (eg bark beetles), a finding that should help to improve predictions of mortality during drought.},

Recent models addressing this problem have brought together population genetics and population ecology, and some have included interactions among species at range edges. Here, we review these models of adaptation at environmental or parapatric margins, and discuss the contrasting effects of migration in either swamping local adaptation, or supplying the genetic variation that is necessary for adaptation to continue. We illustrate how studying adaptation at range margins (both with and without hybridization) can provide insight into the genetic and ecological factors that limit evolution more generally, especially in response to current rates of environmental change.

  abstract = {The classical approach to predicting the geographical extent of species invasions consists of training models in the native range and projecting them in distinct, potentially invasible areas. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this approach could be hampered by a change of the realized climatic niche, allowing invasive species to spread into habitats in the invaded ranges that are climatically distinct from those occupied in the native range. We propose an alternative approach that involves fitting models with pooled data from all ranges. We show that this pooled approach improves prediction of the extent of invasion of spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in North America on models based solely on the European native range. Furthermore, it performs equally well on models based on the invaded range, while ensuring the inclusion of areas with similar climate to the European niche, where the species is likely to spread further. We then compare projections from these models for 2080 under a severe climate warming scenario. Projections from the pooled models show fewer areas of intermediate climatic suitability than projections from the native or invaded range models, suggesting a better consensus among modelling techniques and reduced uncertainty.},

Current reliance on bioclimatic envelope approaches ignores important biological processes such as interactions and dispersal. Although much debated, it is unclear how such processes might influence range shifting. Using individual-based modelling we show that interspecific interactions and dispersal ability interact with the rate of climate change to determine range-shifting dynamics in a simulated community with two growth forms-mutualists and competitors. Interactions determine spatial arrangements of species prior to the onset of rapid climate change. These lead to space-occupancy effects that limit the rate of expansion of the fast-growing competitors but which can be overcome by increased long-distance dispersal. As the rate of climate change increases, lower levels of long-distance dispersal can drive the mutualists to extinction, demonstrating the potential for subtle process balances, non-linear dynamics and abrupt changes from species coexistence to species loss during climate change. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to forecast whether and how species distributions may track these changes. Yet, SDMs generally fail to account for genetic and demographic processes, limiting population-level inferences. We still do not understand how predicted environmental shifts will impact the spatial distribution of genetic diversity within taxa. METHODS: We propose a novel method that predicts spatially explicit genetic and demographic landscapes of populations under future climatic conditions. We use carefully parameterized SDMs as estimates of the spatial distribution of suitable habitats and landscape dispersal permeability under present-day, past, and future conditions. We use empirical genetic data and approximate Bayesian computation to estimate unknown demographic parameters. Finally, we employ these parameters to simulate realistic and complex models of responses to future environmental shifts. We contrast parameterized models under current and future landscapes to quantify the expected magnitude of change. KEY RESULTS: We implement this framework on neutral genetic data available from Penstemon deustus. Our results predict that future climate change will result in geographically widespread declines in genetic diversity in this species. The extent of reduction will heavily depend on the continuity of population networks and deme sizes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide spatially explicit predictions of within-species genetic diversity using climatic, demographic, and genetic data. Our approach accounts for climatic, geographic, and biological complexity. This framework is promising for understanding evolutionary consequences of climate change, and guiding conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Digitalis purpurea was studied as a representative of a plant species with subatlantic geographical distribution in Central Germany with the objective of identifying the underlying climatic causes of the species' eastern distribution boundary. A transplantation experiment with 1-year-old plants and seeds was performed along a ca. 100 km west-east transect across the regional distribution boundary in northwest Thuringia and along an altitudinal transect from 380 m to 1130 m a.s.l. in the Harz Mountains. Continuous measurements of air temperatures below rosette leaves confirmed a clear gradient of increasing mean temperatures with decreasing elevation and, with the exception of one field site, from west to east. Biometrical measurements of the transplants and the survival rate of seedlings generally matched the temperature gradients. Photosynthesis measurements along the elevational transect showed that differences in growth between altitudes were reflected in differences of temperature optima of net assimilation. Seedling mortality was highest in winter at the highest and at the easternmost plot. Although this should be a clear indication of frost sensitivity, there was no satisfactory correlation with absolute minimum temperatures below the rosettes, which exhibited a range between \textendash{}4.1\textdegree{}C and \textendash{}9.2\textdegree{}C. Frost tolerance experiments were carried out in a freeze chamber at the end of the winter. Significant damage to leaves was found at \textendash{}12\textdegree{}C or below; whereas the threshold for buds and roots was \textendash{}15\textdegree{}C and \textendash{}18\textdegree{}C, respectively. Although frost events of this magnitude were not observed below the rosettes during the period of investigation, mainly because of snow cover, they occur regularly in the study area. In addition to the winter conditions, summer drought was found to have a strong influence on growth of adult plants at the eastern sites. This was confirmed by a manipulative experiment with additional watering. Transpiration experiments also showed a strong water deficit in unwatered plants in the east. The general conclusion from the study is that frost events in winter, which mainly affect the survival of seedlings, combined with summer drought periods, which mainly limit growth of adults, explain the eastern distribution boundary of Digitalis purpurea.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary response of plants to herbivory is constrained by the availability of resources in the environment. Woody plants adapted to low-resource environments have intrinsically slow growth rates that limit their capacity to grow rapidly beyond the reach of most browsing mammals. Their low capacity to acquire resources limits their potential for compensatory growth which would otherwise enable them to re- place tissue destroyed by browsing. Plants adapted to low-resource environments have responded to browsing by evolving strong constitutive defenses with relatively low ontogenetic plasticity. Because nutrients are often more limiting than light in boreal forests, slowly growing boreal forest trees utilize carbon-based rather than nitrogen-based defenses. More rapidly growing shade-intolerant trees that are adapted to growth in high-resource environments are selected for competitive ability and can grow rapidly beyond the range of most browsing mammals. Moreover, these plants have the carbon and nutrient reserves necessary to replace tissue lost to browsing through compensatory growth. However, because browsing of juvenile plants reduces vertical growth and thus competitive ability, these plants are selected for resistance to browsing during the juvenile growth phase. Consequently, early successional boreal forest trees have responded to browsing by evolving strong de- fenses during juvenility only. Because severe pruning causes woody plants to revert to a juvenile form, resistance of woody plants to hares increases after severe hare browsing as occurs during hare population outbreaks. This increase in browsing resistance may play a significant role in boreal forest plant-hare interactions. Unlike woody plants, graminoids retain large reserves of carbon and nutrients below ground in both low-resource and high-resource environments and can respond to severe grazing through compensatory growth. These fundamental differences between the response of woody plants and graminoids to vertebrate herbivory suggest that the dynamics of browsing systems and grazing systems are qualitatively different.

It is based on whole-plant and epidermal hydromechanics, and on two hypotheses: (1) the osmotic gradient across guard cell membranes is proportional to the concentration of ATP in the guard cells; and (2) the osmotic gradient that can be sustained per unit of ATP is proportional to the turgor pressure of adjacent epidermal cells. In the present study, guard cell [ATP] is calculated using a previously published model that is based on a widely used biochemical model of C3 mesophyll photosynthesis. The conductance model for Vicia faba L. is parameterized and tested As with most other stomatal models, the present model correctly predicts the stomatal responses to variations in transpiration rate, irradiance and intercellular CO2. Unlike most other models, however, this model can predict the transient stomatal opening often observed before conductance declines in response to decreases in humidity, soil water potential, or xylem conductance. The model also explicitly accommodates the mechanical advantage of the epidermis and correctly predicts that stomata are relatively insensitive to the ambient partial pressure of oxygen, as a result of the assumed dependence on ATP concentration.},

  abstract = {Biologists have long searched for mechanisms responsible for the increase in species richness with decreasing latitude. The strong correlation between species richness and climate is frequently interpreted as reflecting a causal link via processes linked to energy or evolutionary rates. Here, we investigate how the aggregation of clades, as dictated by phylogeny, can give rise to significant climate-richness gradients without gradients in diversification or environmental carrying capacity. The relationship between climate and species richness varies considerably between clades, regions and time periods in a global-scale phylogenetically informed analysis of all terrestrial mammal species. Many young clades show negative richness-temperature slopes (more species at cooler temperatures), with the ages of these clades coinciding with the expansion of temperate climate zones in the late Eocene. In carnivores, we find steeply positive richness-temperature slopes in clades with restricted distributions and tropical origins (e.g. cat clade), whereas widespread, temperate clades exhibit shallow, negative slopes (e.g. dog-bear clade). We show that the slope of the global climate-richness gradient in mammals is driven by aggregating Chiroptera (bats) with their Eutherian sister group. Our findings indicate that the evolutionary history should be accounted for as part of any search for causal links between environment and species richness. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Royal Society.},

Increased plant growth associated with a longer growing season may enhance ecosystem productivity, but shifts to earlier springs may also negatively influence soil moisture status and productivity during the peak of the growing season. Here, we analyzed nearly three decades (1982\textendash{}2008) of observational records and derived products, including satellite microwave and optical imagery as well as upscaled ecosystem flux observations, to better understand how shifts in seasonality impact hydrology and productivity in the North American boreal forests.We identified a dominant adverse influence of earlier springs on peak summer forest greenness, actual evapotranspiration and productivity at interannual time scales across the drier western and central sections of the North American boreal forests. In the vast regions where this spring onset mechanism operates, ecosystem productivity gains from earlier springs during the early portion of the growing season are effectively cancelled through corresponding losses in the later portion. Our results also indicate that recent decadal shifts towards earlier springs and associated drying in the midst of the growing season over western North American boreal forests may have contributed to the reported declines in summer productivity and increases in tree mortality and fire activity.With projections of accelerated northern high-latitude warming and associated shifts to earlier springs, persistent soil moisture deficits in peak summer may be an effective mechanism for regional-scale boreal forest dieback through their strong influence on productivity, tree mortality and disturbance dynamics.

  abstract = {Variance in fitness is well known to influence the outcome of evolution but is rarely considered in the theory of marine reproductive strategies. In coastal environments, turbulent mesoscale eddies can collect larvae into packets, resulting in collective dispersal. Larvae in packets return to the coast or are lost offshore in groups, producing variance in fitness. Using a Markov process to calculate fixation probabilities for competing phenotypes, we examine the evolution of offspring size and spawning duration in species with benthic adults and pelagic offspring. The offspring size that provides mothers with the highest mean fitness also generates the greatest variance in fitness, but pairwise invasion plots show that bet-hedging strategies are not evolutionarily stable; maximizing expected fitness correctly predicts the unique evolutionarily stable strategy. Nonetheless, fixation can take a long time. We find that selection to increase spawning duration as a risk avoidance strategy to reduce the negative impacts of stochastic recruitment success can allow multiple offspring sizes to coexist in a population for extended periods. This has two important consequences for offspring size: (1) coexistence occurs over a broader range of sizes and is longer when spawning duration is longer because longer spawning durations reduce variation in fitness and increase the time to fixation, and (2) longer spawning durations can compensate for having a nonoptimal size and even allow less optimal sizes to reach fixation. Collective dispersal and longer spawning durations could effectively maintain offspring size variation even in the absence of good and bad years or locations. Empirical comparisons of offspring size would therefore not always reflect environment-specific differences in the optimal size.},

Postdocs are expected to move for short-term positions which can often be problematic for early-career researchers, especially those from under-represented groups in STEM. However, the proliferation of computational research has changed how scientists can conduct science, opening the door to postdoctoral work being conducted remotely. Research activities primarily involving quantitative analysis, modeling, writing, and data collection can take place anywhere and therefore can all be conducted on a remote or semi-remote basis. We offer 10 simple rules for overcoming challenges and leveraging the unique opportunities presented by remote postdoc positions, derived from our experiences as either remote postdocs or the PIs who have mentored them. We believe that not only will these suggestions increase the desirability of remote postdoc positions whenever they are feasible, but that they also contain good practices for facilitating better communication both within labs more generally and in other long-distance collaborations.},

  abstract = {A long-term field experiment in limestone grassland near Buxton (North Derbyshire, United Kingdom) was designed to identify plant attributes and vegetation characteristics conducive to successful invasion. Plots containing crossed, continuous gradients of fertilizer addition and disturbance intensity were subjected to a single-seed inoculum comprising a wide range of plant functional types and 54 species not originally present at the site. Several disturbance treatments were applied; these included the creation of gaps of contrasting size and the mowing of the vegetation to different heights and at different times of the year. This paper analyzes the factors controlling the initial phase of the resulting invasions within the plots subject to gap creation. The susceptibility of the indigenous community to invasion was strongly related to the availability of bare ground created, but greatest success occurred where disturbance coincided with eutrophication. Disturbance damage to the indigenous dominants (particularly Festuca ovina) was an important determinant of seedling establishment by the sown invaders. Large seed size was identified as an important characteristic allowing certain species to establish relatively evenly across the productivity-disturbance matrix; smaller-seeded species were more dependent on disturbance for establishment. Successful and unsuccessful invaders were also distinguished to some extent by differences in germination requirements and present geographical distribution. Key words: Derbyshire, UK; disturbance; fertility; field experiment; gaps; gradients; invasibility; invasion; limestone grassland; seed size; seed sowing.},

Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 52 to 89\%, and long distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 65\% of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of at least 1 km. Modelling dispersal functions for pollination events within the two larger populations showed little difference between the four two-parameter models tested and indicated a fat-tailed dispersal curve. Similarity of direct and indirect historical estimates of gene flow indicates maintenance of gene flow at levels experienced prior to fragmentation. The study revealed extensive long distance pollen dispersal in remnant patches of trees within a fragmented agricultural landscape in the southern temperate region and highlighted the role of remnant patches in maintaining genetic connectivity at the landscape scale.},

We examined whether this shade avoidance response varies among and within natural populations of A. thaliana, and whether it corresponds to variable selection regimes at shaded and unshaded field sites, by conducting a two-year reciprocal transplant study and a parallel greenhouse study that manipulated the presence and timing of shade. In the field, shading had limited or inconsistent impacts on survivorship across several phases of the growing season. The date of bolting was earlier at the shadier site compared to the less shady site, but in the greenhouse there was no significant shadeinduced plasticity for this trait. In both studies, we detected directional selection gradients favoring earlier bolting in shade, but gradients favoring earlier bolting were as strong in nonshaded conditions. The number of rosette leaves at bolting (i.e., the developmental stage of flowering) was significantly reduced by shade in both studies. However, there was either no directional selection on this trait, or selection to flower with more rather than fewer leaves. Despite the contrast in habitats, there was limited differentiation between populations for survivorship, reproductive fitness, size-related or flowering time traits, and no differentiation for trait plasticities. Some traits were variable among families within populations. A trade-off between age and developmental stage may limit the response to selection for flowering time, possibly explaining limited local adaptation. The adaptive significance of shade-induced flowering time plasticity remains equivocal. Future studies of the plasticity of flowering time in A. thaliana should investigate the effects of shading regimes together with other environmental variables on size- and timing-related traits.

To gain insight into genetic microstructure of subregional populations of coastal Doug-las-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco var. menziesii), genetic variability in a population found on a 6100-ha, central Oregon watershed is described. Genotypic values of 193 parent trees located throughout the watershed were estimated from progeny grown in a common garden. Then, genetic variation was partitioned into components attributable to parent-tree location and to differences among trees within locations. Within-location variation appeared to be homogeneous in the watershed; between-location variation was related to topography, but the patterns of trait variation differed depending on the trait measured. Growth traits exhibited strong gradients with elevation, but the relationship varied depending on position within the watershed. Based on estimates of proportions of nonadapted seedlings in hypothetical transfers of seed from one part of the watershed to another, genetic differentiation within the watershed was surprisingly large. In one transfer of 3.5 km between north-and south-facing slopes at the same elevation, :80\% of seedlings were estimated to be poorly adapted. Although other possibilities exist, the topoclinal variation in traits probably results from selection as does the large within-location variation. Both kinds of variation are due to high selection intensities in the seedling stage, the former to selection by average environmental differences along gradients, the latter to microenvironmental heterogeneity. The combination of high within-and between-habitat variation is suited to a species which episodically colonizes an environment that is extremely heter-ogeneous in time and space.},

In order to classify measurements made during two intensive field campaigns at Mace Head, on the west coast of Ireland, an objective method of assigning data to different weather types has been developed. Air-mass back trajectories calculated using winds from ECMWF analyses, arriving at the site in 1995-1997, were allocated to clusters based on a statistical analysis of the latitude, longitude and pressure of the trajectory at 12 h intervals over 5 days. The robustness of the analysis was assessed by using an ensemble of back trajectories calculated for four points around Mace Head. Separate analyses were made for each of the 3 years, and for four 3-month periods. The use of these clusters in classifying ground-based ozone measurements at Mace Head is described, including the need to exclude data which have been influenced by local perturbations to the regional flow pattern, for example, by sea breezes. Even with a limited data set, based on 2 months of intensive field measurements in 1996 and 1997, there are statistically significant differences in ozone concentrations in air from the different clusters. The limitations of this type of analysis for classification and interpretation of ground-based chemistry measurements are discussed.},

There is a critical lack of integrated community-wide assessments of drought-induced responses in forests at the macroecological scale, including defoliation, mortality, and food web responses. Here we report a generalized increase in crown defoliation in southern European forests occurring during 1987-2007. Forest tree species have consistently and significantly altered their crown leaf structures, with increased percentages of defoliation in the drier parts of their distributions in response to increased water deficit. We assessed the demographic responses of trees associated with increased defoliation in southern European forests, specifically in the Iberian Peninsula region. We found that defoliation trends are paralleled by significant increases in tree mortality rates in drier areas that are related to tree density and temperature effects. Furthermore, we show that severe drought impacts are associated with sudden changes in insect and fungal defoliation dynamics, creating long-term disruptive effects of drought on food webs. Our results reveal a complex geographical mosaic of species-specific responses to climate change-driven drought pressures on the Iberian Peninsula, with an overwhelmingly predominant trend toward increased drought damage.},

Understandably, the conservation community holds a range of opinions about target-based approaches to conservation planning. One school of thought is that the approach is inadequate, inflexible, and even counterproductive in many socioecological systems. We investigate the perceived limitations of target-based conservation planning, and find that most have resulted from poor communication and misuse of targets, leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings. Here we put target-based conservation planning in context by: (1) summarizing reported limitations of the approach and differentiating between those that are real and those that are misconceived; (2) identifying ways that some of the real limitations have, and can, be overcome, and (3) comparing target-based conservation planning to alternative conservation prioritization approaches. We hope to stimulate further discussion that will guide and improve target-based conservation planning.},

For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. abstract: Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set in-traspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center over-whelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific compe-tition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model in-cludes local population growth, movements over space, natural se-lection, and gene flow. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirk-patrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or bar-riers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific compe-tition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that re-sults from this displacement does not necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then},

  abstract = {Author Summary \textbackslash{}nNatural selection exerts its influence by changing allele frequencies at genomic polymorphisms. Alleles associated with harmful traits decrease in frequency while those associated with beneficial traits become more common. In a simple case, selection acts on a trait controlled by a single polymorphism; a large change in allele frequency at this polymorphism can eliminate a deleterious phenotype from a population or fix a beneficial one. However, many phenotypes, including diseases like Type 2 Diabetes, Crohn's disease, and prostate cancer, and physiological traits like height, weight, and hair color, are controlled by multiple genomic loci. Selection may act on such traits by influencing allele frequencies at a single associated polymorphism or by altering allele frequencies at many associated polymorphisms. To search for cases of the latter, we assembled groups of genomic polymorphisms sharing a common trait association and examined their allele frequencies across 53 globally distributed populations looking for commonalities in allelic behavior across geographical space. We find that variants associated with blood pressure tend to correlate with latitude, while those associated with HIV/AIDS progression correlate well with longitude. We also find evidence that selection may be acting worldwide to increase the frequencies of alleles that elevate autoimmune disease risk.},

  abstract = {Understanding how natural populations will respond to rapid anthropogenic climate change is one of the greatest challenges for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Much research has focussed on whether physiological traits can evolve quickly enough under rapidly increasing temperatures. While the simple Breeder's equation helps to understand how extreme temperatures and genetic variation might drive within-population evolution under climate change, it does not consider two key areas: how different forms of phenotypic plasticity interact and variation among populations. Plasticity can modify the exposure to climatic extremes and the strength of selection from those extremes, while differences among populations provide adaptive diversity not apparent within them. Here, we focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, with a case study on a tropical lizard, demonstrate the complex interplay between spatial, genetic and plastic contributions to variation in climate-relevant physiological traits. We identify several problems that need to be better understood: which traits are under selection in a changing climate; the different forms of plasticity relevant to population persistence and rapid evolution; plastic versus genetic contributions to geographic variation in climate-associated traits and whether plasticity can be harnessed to promote persistence of species. Given ongoing uncertainties around whether natural populations can evolve rapidly enough to persist, we advocate the use of field trials aimed at increasing rates of adaptation, especially in systems known to be strongly impacted by human-driven changes in climate.},

These challenges will be overlaid on a background of historically modified and fragmented forests managed in a wide range of ways for different objectives. As northern temperate forests are species-poor in a global context, their resilience to these challenges is fundamentally dependent on the resilience of individual species. However, dealing with each new threat as it arises is unlikely to be cost-effective and probably impractical. A better strategy for establishing long-term resilience would be to harness evolutionary processes, to maximize the capability of individual tree species to respond to new threats by the reorganization of populations via natural selection; in other words, to be resilient. Such processes depend on the internal variability of species, their mechanisms of dispersal and their ability to recruit new genotypes to a population. In this position paper, we review the theoretical concept of resilience, examine how it might be applied to tree populations and assess the state of knowledge of Britain's forests from this perspective.},

  abstract = {Aim Phenology of a wide diversity of organisms has a dependency on climate, usually with reproductive periods beginning earlier in the year and lasting longer at lower latitudes. Temperature and day length are known environmental drivers of the reproductive timing of many species. Hence, reproductive phenology is sensitive to warming and is important to be considered for reliable predictions of species distributions. This is particularly relevant for rapidly spreading non-indigenous species (NIS). In this study, we forecast the future ranges of a NIS, the seaweed Sargassum muticum, including its reproductive phenology. Location Coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere (Pacific and Atlantic oceans). Methods We used ecological niche modelling to predict the distribution of S. muticum under two scenarios forecasting limited (RCP 2.6) and severe (RCP 8.5) future climate changes. We then refined our predictions with a hybrid model using sea surface temperature constraints on reproductive phenology. Results Under the most severe climate change scenario, we predicted northward expansions which may have significant ecological consequences for subarctic coastal ecosystems. However, in lower latitudes, habitats currently occupied by S. muticum will no longer be suitable, creating opportunities for substantial community changes. The temperature constraints imposed by the reproductive window were shown to restrict the modelled future species expansion strongly. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the total range area was expected to increase by 61.75\% by 2100, but only by 1.63\% when the reproductive temperature window was considered. Main conclusions Altogether these results exemplify the need to integrate phenology better to improve the prediction of future distributional shifts at local and regional scales.},

Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

We investigate the consequences of heterogeneous mutational effects among loci on the genetics of adaptation. We use a generalization of Fisher's geometrical model, which assumes multivariate Gaussian stabilizing selection on multiple characters. In our model, mutation has a distinct variance\textendash{}covariance matrix of phenotypic effects for each locus. Consequently, the distribution of selection coefficients s varies across loci. We assume each locus can only affect a limited number of independent linear combinations of phenotypic traits (restricted pleiotropy), which differ among loci, an effect we term ``orientation heterogeneity.'' Restricted pleiotropy can sharply reduce the overall proportion of beneficial mutations. Orientation heterogeneity has little impact on the shape of the genomic distribution, but can substantially increase the probability of parallel evolution (the repeated fixation of beneficial mutations at the same gene in independent populations), which is highest with low pleiotropy. We also consider variation in the degree of pleiotropy and in the mean s across loci. The latter impacts the genomic distribution of s, but has a much milder effect on parallel evolution. We discuss these results in the light of evolution experiments.},

This process has recently been investigated theoretically, but testing the quantitative predictions in the wild is challenging because (i) there are usually not enough population replicates to deal with the stochasticity of the evolutionary process, (ii) environmental conditions are not controlled, and (iii) measuring selection and the inheritance of traits affecting fitness is difficult in natural populations. As an alternative, predictions from theory can be tested in the laboratory with controlled experiments. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, we briefly review the literature on the experimental evolution of plasticity, and on evolutionary rescue in the laboratory, paying particular attention to differences and similarities between microbes and multicellular eukaryotes. We then highlight a set of questions that could be addressed using this framework, which would enable testing the robustness of theoretical predictions, and provide new insights into areas that have received little theoretical attention to date.},

In addition, cross-site comparisons showed that abundance fluctuations were smaller at species-rich sites, consistent with the idea that stable environmental conditions promote higher diversity.

  abstract = {Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]) is expected to result in warmer temperatures and changed precipitation regimes during this century. In the northwestern U.S., these changes will likely decrease snowpack, cause earlier snowmelt, increase summer evapotranspiration, and increase the frequency and severity of droughts. Elevated [CO2] and warmer temperatures may have positive effects on growth and productivity where there is adequate moisture or growth is currently limited by cold. However, the effects of climate change are generally expected to reduce growth and survival, predispose forests to disturbance by wildfire, insects, and disease; and ultimately change forest structure and composition at the landscape scale. Substantial warming will likely decrease winter chilling resulting in delayed bud burst, and adversely affect flowering and seed germination for some species. The extent of these effects will depend on the magnitude of climate change, the abilities of individual trees to acclimate, and for tree populations to adapt in situ, or to migrate to suitable habitats. These coping mechanisms may be insufficient to maintain optimal fitness of tree populations to rapidly changing climate. Physiological responses to climatic stresses are relatively well-understood at the organ or whole-plant scale but not at the stand or landscape scale. In particular, the interactive effects of multiple stressors is not well known. Genetic and silvicultural approaches to increase adaptive capacities and to decrease climate-related vulnerabilities of forests can be based on ecophysiological knowledge. Effective approaches to climate adaptation will likely include assisted migration of species and populations, and density management. Use of these approaches to increase forest resistance and resilience at the landscape scale requires a better understanding of species adaptations, within-species genetic variation, and the mitigating effects of silvicultural treatments. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Carex curvula is a dominant sedge of European alpine tundra, exhibiting two morphological forms: C. curvula ssp. curvula (Ccc) and C. curvula ssp. rosae (Ccr). In this paper, we attempt to explore whether Ccc and Ccr are ecotypes or vicariant forms and whether between- and within-regional distribution patterns can be explained by variations in the amount of available habitats and/or by changes in niche attributes. The study area covered three bioclimatically distinct regions of the southwestern Alps in which local abundances of Ccc and Ccr strongly differ. The realized niche of both forms was investigated by a direct gradient analysis performed on an extensive floristic and environmental data set. We found no evidence of niche overlap between Ccc and Ccr as their distribution curves differ strongly along disturbance, mesotopography and soil acidity gradients. We investigated the effect of region on the structure of local scale variables tables. Highly concordant patterns among regions were found, except that optimal habitat conditions for Ccc were infrequent in the southernmost regions. We compared the ecological behaviour of range centre and range margin populations of each form. We found a narrower ecological amplitude for Ccr in the northern part of its range, whereas for Ccc the niche breadth of range-margin populations was not reduced compared to range centre populations. At its southern range limit, Ccc mostly occupies ecologically marginal habitats. We conclude that Ccc and Ccr represent ecotypes, not vicariant forms. Finally, we suggest that habitat availability, resulting from the interplay of regional-scale and local-scale variables, satisfactorily explains the distributional patterns of Carex curvula ecotypes in the southwestern Alps.},

Previous studies concerning the performance of these models have shown that they were unable to make accurate predictions based on external data. One of the reasons for such inaccuracy may be wrong estimations of the parameters of each model due to the non-convergence of the optimization algorithm towards their maximum likelihood. We proposed to fit these four models using a simulated annealing method which is known to avoid local extrema of any kind of function, and thus is particularly well adapted to fit budburst models, as their likelihood function presents many local maxima. We tested this method using a phenological dataset deduced from aero-palynological data. Annual pollen spectra were used to estimate the dates of flowering of the populations around the sampling station. The results show that simulated annealing provides a better fit than traditional methods, Despite this improvement, classical models still failed to predict external data. We expect the simulated annealing method to allow reliable comparisons among models, leading to a selection of biologically relevant ones.},

The purpose of this study was to examine different assumptions of budburst models and select those which are best supported by the data, defining new models able to predict external data. Eight models, each differing in one assumption, were fitted and tested using external data. The dataset used to test the models was deduced from aeropalynological data at two stations in France. The results show that some of the models proposed are able to accurately predict external dates of flowering of most of the studied species. The assumptions of those models have been individually tested and shown to improve the models accuracy. Robust estimates of the best predictor models of 12 tree species are presented. The analysis of hypothetical provenance transfer of two species, Buxus sempervirens and Platanus acerifolia, between the two study sites, shows that P. acerifolia estimates are similar in both environments whereas B. sempervirens estimates are variable. This result, which agrees with the genetic characteristics of both species, shows that local adaptation of phenology can also be studied through modelling approaches.},

  abstract = {Accurate plant phenology (seasonal plant activity driven by environmental factors) models are vital tools for ecosystem simulation models and for predicting the response of ecosystems to climate change. Since the early 1970s, efforts have concentrated on predicting phenology of the temperate and boreal forests because they represent one-third of the carbon captured in plant ecosystems and they are the principal ecosystems with seasonal patterns of growth on Earth (one-fifth of the plant ecosystems area). Numerous phenological models have been developed to predict the growth timing of temperate or boreal trees. They are in general empirical, nonlinear and non-nested. For these reasons they are particularly difficult to fit, to test and to compare with each other. The methodological difficulties as well as the diversity of models used have greatly slowed down their improvement. The aim of this study was to show that the most widely used models simulating vegetative or reproductive phenology of trees are particular cases of a more general model. This unified model has three main advantages. First, it allows for a direct estimation of (i) the response of bud growth to either chilling or forcing temperatures and (ii) the periods when these temperatures affect the bud growth. Second, it can be simplified according to standard statistical tests for any particular species. Third, it provides a standardized framework for phenological models, which is essential for comparative studies as well as for robust model identification. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The estimated temperature threshold of the provenance growth responses (i.e., the temperature for which the response reaches half of its maximum) varied between 4.1 and 6.5\textdegree{}C among regions. Threshold temperatures showed less variation than total elongation, and only the northern provenances showed thresholds significantly different from the other regions.

However, very few models are able to predict species distribution accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power when tested against present distributions of two North American species - quaking aspen and sugar maple - indicating that on a broad scale, the fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche. Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.},

Basler (``Phenology under global warming,'' Perspectives, 19 March, p. 1461) suggest that because of photoperiodic constraints, observed effects of temperature on spring life-cycle events cannot be extrapolated to future temperature conditions. However, no study has demonstrated that photoperiod is more dominant than temperature when predicting leaf senescence (1), leafing, or flowering, even in beech\textemdash{}one of the species most sensitive to photoperiod (2, 3). On the contrary, the literature [e.g., (4, 5)] supports the idea that spring phenology is highly dependent on temperature during both the endodormancy phase (the period during which the plant remains dormant due internal factors) and the ecodormancy phase (the period during which the plant remains dormant due to external, environmental conditions). Warming temperatures have a negative impact on endodormancy (the chilling requirement is unfulfilled, delaying dormancy break) and a positive impact on ecodormancy (bud cell growth accelerates). Therefore, tree phenology does not respond linearly to increasing temperature (6, 7). The key concern should be quantitatively assessing the net balance between these antagonistic warming effects on spring phenology.},

  abstract = {The onset of the growing season of trees has been earlier by 2.3~days per decade during the last 40~years in temperate Europe because of global warming. The effect of temperature on plant phenology is, however, not linear because temperature has a dual effect on bud development. On one hand, low temperatures are necessary to break bud endodormancy, and, on the other hand, higher temperatures are necessary to promote bud cell growth afterward. Different process-based models have been developed in the last decades to predict the date of budbreak of woody species. They predict that global warming should delay or compromise endodormancy break at the species equatorward range limits leading to a delay or even impossibility to flower or set new leaves. These models are classically parameterized with flowering or budbreak dates only, with no information on the endodormancy break date because this information is very scarce. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of a set of phenological models to accurately predict the endodormancy break dates of three fruit trees. Our results show that models calibrated solely with budbreak dates usually do not accurately predict the endodormancy break date. Providing endodormancy break date for the model parameterization results in much more accurate prediction of this latter, with, however, a higher error than that on budbreak dates. Most importantly, we show that models not calibrated with endodormancy break dates can generate large discrepancies in forecasted budbreak dates when using climate scenarios as compared to models calibrated with endodormancy break dates. This discrepancy increases with mean annual temperature and is therefore the strongest after 2050 in the southernmost regions. Our results claim for the urgent need of massive measurements of endodormancy break dates in forest and fruit trees to yield more robust projections of phenological changes in a near future.},

I use field estimates of seed dispersal with an integrodifference equation and simulation models of population growth to show that dispersal data are compatible with rapid spread. Dispersal estimates lay to rest the possibility that rapid spread occurred by diffusion. The integrodifference model predicts that, if the seed shadow has a long 'fat' tail, then rapid spread is possible, despite short average dispersal distances. It further predicts that velocity is more sensitive to life history than is classical diffusion. Application of such models is frustrated because the tail of the seed shadow cannot be fitted to data. However, the data can be used to test a 'long-distance' hypothesis against alternative ('local') models of dispersal using Akaike's Information Criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Tests show that data are consistent with {$>$}10\% of seed dispersed as a long (10(2) m) fat-tailed kernel. Models based on such kernels predict spread as rapid as that inferred from the pollen record. If fat-tailed dispersal explains these rapid rates, then it is surprising not to see large differences in velocities among taxa with contrasting life histories. The inference of rapid spread, together with lack of obvious life-history effects, suggests velocities may have not reached their potentials, being stalled by rates of climate change, geography, or both.},

  abstract = {Colonization\textendash{}competition trade-offs represent a stabilizing mechanism that is thought to maintain diversity of forest trees. If so, then early-successional species should benefit from high capacity to colonize new sites, and late-successional species should be good competitors. Tests of this hypothesis in forests have been precluded by an inability to estimate the many factors that contribute to seed production and dispersal, particularly the many types of stochasticity that contribute to fecundity data. We develop a hierarchical Bayes modeling structure, and we use it to estimate fecundity schedules from the two types of data that ecologists typically collect, including seed-trap counts and observations of tree status. The posterior density is obtained using Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques. The flexible structure yields estimates of size and covariate effects on seed production, variability associated with population heterogeneity, and interannual stochasticity (variability and se-rial autocorrelation), sex ratio, and dispersal. It admits the errors in data associated with the ability to accurately recognize tree status and process misspecification. We estimate year-by-year seed-production rates for all individuals in each of nine sample stands from two regions and up to 11 years. A rich characterization of differences among species and relationships among individuals allows evaluation of a number of hypotheses related to masting, effective population sizes, and location and covariate effects. It demonstrates large bias in previous methods. We focus on implications for colonization\textendash{}competition and a related hypothesis, the successional niche\textemdash{}trade-offs in the capacity to exploit high re-source availability in early successional environments vs. the capacity to survive low-resource conditions late in succession. Contrary to predictions of trade-off hypotheses, we find no relationship between suc-cessional status and fecundity, dispersal, or expected arrivals at distant sites. Results suggest a mechanism for maintenance of diversity that may be more general than colonization\textendash{} competition and successional niches. High variability and strong individual effects (vari-ability within populations) generate massive stochasticity in recruitment that, when com-bined with ''storage,'' may provide a stabilizing mechanism. The storage effect stabilizes diversity when species differences ensure that responses to stochasticity are not highly correlated among species. Process variability and individual effects mean that many species have the advantage at different times and places even in the absence of ''deterministic'' trade-offs. Not only does colonization vary among species, but also individual behavior is highly stochastic and weakly correlated among members of the same population. Although these factors are the dominant sources of variability in data sets (substantially larger than the deterministic relationships typically examined), they have not been not included in the models that ecologists have used to evaluate mechanisms of species coexistence (e.g., even individual-based models lack random individual effects). Recognition of the mechanisms of coexistence requires not only heuristic models that capture the principal sources of stochasticity, but also data-modeling techniques that allow for their estimation.},

From annual measurements on a few trees (e.g., increment cores) or sporadic measurements from many trees (e.g., diameter censuses on mapped plots), relationships with resources, tree size, and climate are extrapolated to whole stands. There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for "filling the gaps" for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth. An example involving multiple species and multiple stands with tree-ring data and up to 14 years of tree census data illustrates how different levels of information at the tree and stand level contribute to inference and prediction.},

  abstract = {Forecasting how global warming will affect onset of the growing season is essential for predicting terrestrial productivity, but suffers from conflicting evidence. We show that accurate estimates require ways to connect discrete observations of changing tree status (e.g., pre- vs. post budbreak) with continuous responses to fluctuating temperatures. By coherently synthesizing discrete observations with continuous responses to temperature variation, we accurately quantify how increasing temperature variation accelerates onset of growth. Application to warming experiments at two latitudes demonstrates that maximum responses to warming are concentrated in late winter, weeks ahead of the main budbreak period. Given that warming will not occur uniformly over the year, knowledge of when temperature variation has the most impact can guide prediction. Responses are large and heterogeneous, yet predictable. The approach has immediate application to forecasting effects of warming on growing season length, requiring only information that is readily available from weather stations and generated in climate models.},

Physiological studies show that mortality results from interactions between climate and competition at the individual scale. Models of forest response to climate do not include Accepted Article The recent global increase in forest mortality episodes could not have been predicted from current vegetation models that are calibrated to regional climate data. Physiological studies show that mortality results from interactions between climate and competition at the individual scale. Models of forest response to climate do not include interactions because they are hard to estimate and require long-term observations on individual trees obtained at frequent (annual) intervals. Interactions involve multiple tree responses that can only be quantified if these responses are estimated as a joint distribution. A new approach provides estimates of climate- competition interactions in two critical ways, 1) among individuals, as a joint distribution of responses to combinations of inputs, such as resources and climate, and 2) within individuals, due to allocation requirements that control outputs, such as demographic rates. Application to 20 years of data from climate and competition gradients shows that interactions control forest responses, and their omission from models leads to inaccurate predictions. Species most vulnerable to increasing aridity are not those that show the largest growth response to precipitation, but rather depend on interactions with the local resource environment. This first assessment of regional species vulnerability that is based on the scale at which climate operates, individual trees competing for carbon and water, supports predictions of potential savannification in the southeastern US.},

  abstract = {Increases in primary production may occur if plants respond to climate warming with prolonged growing seasons, but not if local adaptation, cued by photoperiod, limits phenological advance. It has been hypothesized that trees with diffuse porous xylem anatomy and early successional species may respond most to warming. Within species, northern populations may respond most due to the fact that growing seasons are relatively short. Species most sensitive to spring temperature may show little overall response to warming if reduced chilling in fall/winter offsets accelerated winter/spring development. Because current thermal models consider only highly aggregated variables, e.g., degree days or chilling units (temperature sums for a season or year) they may not accurately represent warming effects. We show that assumptions contained in current thermal (degree-day) models are unrealistic for climate change analysis. Critical threshold parameters are not identifiable, and they do not actually have much to do with thresholds for development. Traditional models further overlook the discrete nature of observations, observation error, and the continuous response of phenological development to temperature variation. An alternative continuous development model (CDM) that addresses these problems is applied to a large experimental warming study near northern and southern boundaries of 15 species in the eastern deciduous forest of the US, in North Carolina and Massachusetts. Results provide a detailed time course of phenological development, including vernalization during winter and warming in spring, and challenge the basic assumptions of thermal models. Where traditional models find little evidence of a chilling effect (most are insignificant or have the wrong sign), the continuous development model finds evidence of chilling effects in most species. Contrary to the hypothesis that northern populations respond most, we find southern populations are most responsive. Because northern populations already have a compressed period for spring development they may lack flexibility to further advance development. A stronger response in the southern range could allow residents to resist northward migration of immigrants as climate warms. If potential invaders fail to exploit a prolonged growing season to the same degree as residents, then there is a resident advantage. Hypothesized effects of warming for xylem anatomy and successional status are not supported by the 15 species in this study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Bryophytes typically represent a significant portion of alpine floras with many species specific to highland systems. Differences between highland and lowland bryophytes have been underinvestigated. In the present study spanning three growing seasons, a subalpine and a lowland moss were both reciprocally planted as apical fragments and transplanted as adults between sites at 1400 m and 2000 m in the Front Ranges of the Rocky Mountains, Alberta. The lowland species, Mnium spinulosum, was less tolerant of conditions at 2000 m than the subalpine species, M. arizonicum, was to conditions at 1400 m. In particular, M. spinulosum had lower establishment from both apical fragments and spores at higher elevation sites. Both species had significantly lower establishment during the abnormally cold growing season of 1999, but fragments of M. arizonicum were better able to adjust their investment in establishment. The effect of a dominant feather moss, Hylocomium splendens, on establishment and transplant health was tested for M. arizonicum. Establishment of M. arizonicum was lower in Hylocomium mats than on bare humus regardless of site elevation suggesting allelopathy; however, stem survival in adult transplants was higher in Hylocomium mats than in Mnium dominated microsites at the higher elevation suggesting facilitation. Competition, rather than a lack of physiological plasticity, probably determines the lower elevation limit of the subalpine moss, while poor establishment ability at low temperatures accounts for the upper elevation limit of the montane moss.},

These experimentally simulated global changes increased availability of important resources for plant growth, leading to the hypothesis that species with the most positive growth and foliar nutrient responses would experience the greatest increase in herbivory. Counter to the expectations, shifts in tissue N and growth rates caused by N deposition did not predict shifts in herbivore consumption rates. N deposition increased seedling N concentrations and growth rates but did not increase herbivore consumption overall, or for any individual species. Elevated CO2 did not influence growth rates nor have a statistically significant influence on seedling N concentrations. Elevated CO2 at ambient N levels caused a decline in the number of seedlings consumed, but the interaction between CO2 and N addition differed among species. The results of this study indicate that shifting patterns of herbivory will likely influence species composition as environmental conditions change in the future; however, a simple trade-off between shifting growth rates and palatability is not evident.},

At each site, each species has been classified according to a number of easily identified categorical functional traits, including life history, life form, the number of cotyledons, height relative to the canopy, potential for clonal growth, and nativity to the United States.

They are good examples of informal institutions, where norms, rather than governmental juridical laws and rules, determine human behavior. In many traditional societies throughout the world, taboos frequently guide human conduct toward the natural environment. Based on a survey of recent literature, we synthesize information on such taboos. We refer to them as "resource and habitat taboos" (RHTs). Examples are grouped in six different categories depending on their potential nature conservation and management functions. We compare RHTs with contemporary measures of conservation and identify and discuss some key benefits that may render them useful in partnership designs for conservation and management. We conclude that many RHTs have functions similar to those of formal institutions for nature conservation in contemporary society but have not been sufficiently recognized in this capacity. We suggest that designs for conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use in developing countries focus more on informal institutions, like social taboos, because they may offer several advantages compared to conventional measures. These include non-costly, voluntary compliance features implicit in the taboo system.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Temperatures in southwestern North America are projected to increase 3.5\textendash{}4 \textdegree{}C over the next 60\textendash{}90 years. This will precipitate ecological shifts as the ranges of species change in response to new climates. During this shift, rapid-colonizing species should increase, whereas slow-colonizing species will at first decrease, but eventually become reestablished in their new range. This successional process has been estimated to require from 100 to over 300 years in small areas, under a stable climate, with a nearby seed source. How much longer will it require on a continental scale, under a changing climate, without a nearby seed source? I considered this question through an examination of the response of fossil plant assemblages from the Grand Canyon, Arizona, to the most recent rapid warming of similar magnitude that occurred at the start of the Holocene, 11,700 years ago. At that time, temperatures in southwestern North America increased about 4 \textdegree{}C over less than a century. Grand Canyon plant species responded at different rates to this warming climate. Early-successional species rapidly increased, whereas late-successional species decreased. This shift persisted throughout the next 2700 years. I found two earlier, less-extreme species shifts following rapid warming events around 14,700 and 16,800 years ago. Late-successional species predominated only after 4000 years or more of relatively stable temperature. These results suggest the potential magnitude, duration, and nature of future ecological changes and have implications for conservation plans, especially those incorporating equilibrium assumptions or reconstituting past conditions. When these concepts are extended to include the most rapid early-successional colonizers, they imply that the recent increases in invasive exotics may be only the most noticeable part of a new resurgence of early-successional vegetation. Additionally, my results challenge the reliability of models of future vegetation and carbon balance that project conditions on the basis of assumptions of equilibrium within only a century.},

However, costs of adaptation may generate fitness tradeoffs and lead to some compromise between specialization and generalization that maximizes fitness. Here, we evaluate the evolution of specialization and generalization in 20 populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved in constant and variable thermal environments for three years. We developed genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered by theoretical models of developmental plasticity. Specifically, genotypes from the temporally variable selective environment were more fecund across all temperatures than were genotypes from other environments. These patterns suggest certain allelic effects and should inspire new directions for modeling adaptation to fluctuating environments.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering the timing and duration of the vernal window, a period that marks the end of winter and the start of the growing season when rapid transitions in ecosystem energy, water, nutrient, and carbon dynamics take place. Research on this period typically captures only a portion of the ecosystem in transition and focuses largely on the dates by which the system wakes up. Previous work has not addressed lags between transitions that represent delays in energy, water, nutrient, and carbon flows. The objectives of this study were to establish the sequence of physical and biogeochemical transitions and lags during the vernal window period and to understand how climate change may alter them. We synthesized observations from a statewide sensor network in New Hampshire, USA, that concurrently monitored climate, snow, soils, and streams over a three-year period and supplemented these observations with climate reanalysis data, snow data assimilation model output, and satellite spectral data. We found that some of the transitions that occurred within the vernal window were sequential, with air temperatures warming prior to snow melt, which preceded forest canopy closure. Other transitions were simultaneous with one another and had zero-length lags, such as snowpack disappearance, rapid soil warming, and peak stream discharge. We modeled lags as a function of both winter coldness and snow depth, both of which are expected to decline with climate change. Warmer winters with less snow resulted in longer lags and a more protracted vernal window. This lengthening of individual lags and of the entire vernal window carries important consequences for the thermodynamics and biogeochemistry of ecosystems, both during the winter-to-spring transition and throughout the rest of the year.},

  abstract = {Severe drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster to strike North America. A remarkable network of centuries-long annual tree-ring chronologies has now allowed for the reconstruction of past drought over North America covering the past 1000 or more years in most regions. These reconstructions reveal the occurrence of past "megadroughts" of unprecedented severity and duration, ones that have never been experienced by modern societies in North America. There is strong archaeological evidence for the destabilizing influence of these past droughts on advanced agricultural societies, examples that should resonate today given the increasing vulnerability of modern water-based systems to relatively short-term droughts. Understanding how these megadroughts develop and persist is a timely scientific problem. Very recently, climate models have succeeded in simulating all of the major droughts over North America from the Civil War to the severe 1998-2004 drought in the western U.S. These numerical experiments indicate the dominating importance of tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in determining how much precipitation falls over large parts of North America. Of central importance to drought formation is the development of cool "La Ni{\~n}a-like" SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific region. This development appears to be partially linked to changes in radiative forcing over that region, which affects the Bjerknes feedback mechanism of the ENSO cycle there. Paradoxically, warmer conditions over the tropical Pacific region lead to the development of cool La Ni{\~n}a-like SSTs there, which is drought inducing over North America. Whether or not this process will lead to a greater prevalence of drought in the future as the world warms due to accumulating greenhouse gases is unclear at this time. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Yet the record of Quaternary fossil insects shows no high extinction rates during this period. Constancy of species and communities of species can be demonstrated to be the norm for at least the last million or so years ( = generations).

Researchers are often interested in identifying the processes responsible for such change. We derive an equation to exactly decompose change in the mean value of a phenotypic trait into contributions from fluctuations in the demographic structure and age-specific viability selection, fertility selection, phenotypic plasticity, and differences between offspring and parental trait values. We treat fitness as a sum of its components rather than as a scalar and explicitly consider age structure by focusing on short time steps, which are appropriate for describing phenotypic change in species with overlapping generations. We apply the method to examine stasis in birth weight in a well-characterized population of red deer. Stasis is achieved because positive viability selection for an increase in birth weight is countered by parents producing offspring that are, on average, smaller than they were at birth. This is one of many ways in which equilibria in the mean value of a phenotypic trait can be maintained. The age-structured Price equation we derive has the potential to provide considerable insight into the processes generating now frequently reported cases of rapid phenotypic change.},

In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.},

  abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

  abstract = {In many pine species (Family Pinaceae), ovulate cones structurally resemble a turbine, which has been widely interpreted as an adaptation for improving pollination by producing complex aerodynamic effects. We tested the turbine interpretation by quantifying patterns of pollen accumulation on ovulate cones in a wind tunnel and by using simulation models based on computational fluid dynamics. We used computer-aided design and computed tomography to create computational fluid dynamics model cones. We studied three species: Pinus radiata, Pinus sylvestris, and Cedrus libani. Irrespective of the approach or species studied, we found no evidence that turbine-like aerodynamics made a significant contribution to pollen accumulation, which instead occurred primarily by simple impaction. Consequently, we suggest alternative adaptive interpretations for the structure of ovulate cones.},

  abstract = {As the climate warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However, range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates whether warming,is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4degreesC over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3degreesC. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.},

However, little is known about how variation in the pattern of landscape mosaics affects the detectability of landscape genetic relationships. The goal of this paper is to explore the impacts of limiting factors on landscape genetic pro- cesses using simulation modeling. We used spatially explicit, individual-based simulation modeling to quantify the effects of habitat area, fragmentation and the contrast in resistance between habitat and non-habitat on the apparent strength and statistical detectability of landscape genetic relationships. We found that landscape genetic effects are often not detectable when habitat is highly connected. In such situations landscape structure does not limit gene flow. We also found that contrast in resistance values between habitat and non-habitat interacts with habitat extensiveness and fragmentation to affect detectability of landscape genetic relationships. Thus, the influence of landscape features critical to providing connectivity may not be detectable if gene flow is not limited by spatial patterns or resistance contrast of these features. We developed regression equations that reliably predict whe- ther or not isolation by resistance will be detected inde- pendently of isolation by distance as a function of habitat fragmentation and contrast in resistance between habitat and non-habitat},

Little is known about statistical power and inference in individual-based landscape genetics. Our objective was to evaluate the power of causalmodelling with partial Mantel tests in individual-based landscape genetic analysis. We used a spatially explicit simulation model to generate genetic data across a spatially distributed population as functions of several alternative gene flow processes. This allowed us to stipulate the actual process that is in action, enabling formal evaluation of the strength of spurious correlations with incorrect models. We evaluated the degree to which na\i\textasciidieresis{}ve correlational approaches can lead to incorrect attribution of the driver of observed genetic structure. Second, we evaluated the power of causal modelling with partial Mantel tests on resistance gradients to correctly identify the explanatory model and reject incorrect alternative models. Third, we evaluated how rapidly after the landscape genetic process is initiated that we are able to reliably detect the effect of the correct model and reject the incorrect models. Our analyses suggest that simple correlational analyses between genetic data and proposed explanatory models produce strong spurious correlations, which lead to incorrect inferences. We found that causal modelling was extremely effective at rejecting incorrect explanations and correctly identifying the true causal process. We propose a generalized framework for landscape genetics based on analysis of the spatial genetic relationships among individual organisms relative to alternative hypotheses that define functional relationships between landscape features and spatial population processes.},

These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with La Ni{\~n}a-like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El-Ni{\~n}o-like SSTs causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), tropical Atlantic SSTs, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21st century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20\textendash{}50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models' ability to predict tropical SSTs.

Because of their nephrotoxicity, this class of antibiotics are frequently underprescribed and giving at an insufficient dosage when prescribed. That is why therapeutical drug monitoring (TDM) of aminoglycosides is recommanded to assess efficacy. Unfortunately, this TDM allows not a dosage adaptation on the first dose of aminoglycosides. The aim of the work was to elaborate a model using simple pharmacokinetics formulae to estimate gentamicin peak levels and so to propose an optimal a priori dosage on the first dose of gentamicin. The final model was tested out on 24 patients treated by gentamicin. The model was able to predict gentamicin peak levels in 62\% of patients with a 10\% precision and in 79\% of patients with a 15\% precision. Using this simple and practical tool might avoid under-dosage of gentamicin and clinical failure due to the selection of resistant bacteriae. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

  abstract = {The demand for spatial climate data in digital form has risen dramatically in recent years. In response to this need, a variety of statistical techniques have been used to facilitate the production of GIS-compatible climate maps. However, observational data are often too sparse and unrepresentative to directly support the creation of high-quality climate maps and data sets that truly represent the current state of knowledge, An effective approach is to use the wealth of expert knowledge on the spatial patterns of climate and their relationships with geographic features, termed 'geospatial climatology', to help enhance, control, and parameterize a statistical technique. Described here is a dynamic knowledge-based framework that allows for the effective accumulation, application, and refinement of climatic knowledge, as expressed in a statistical regression model known as PRISM (parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model). The ultimate goal is to develop an expert system capable of reproducing the process a knowledgeable climatologist would use to create high-quality climate maps, with the added benefits of consistency and repeatability. However, knowledge must first be accumulated and evaluated through an ongoing process of model application; development of knowledge prototypes, parameters and parameter settings; testing; evaluation; and modification. This paper describes the current state of a knowledge-based framework for climate mapping and presents specific algorithms from PRISM to demonstrate how this framework is applied and refined to accommodate difficult climate mapping situations. A weighted climate-elevation regression function acknowledges the dominant influence of elevation on climate. Climate stations are assigned weights that account for other climatically important factors besides elevation. Aspect and topographic exposure, which affect climate at a variety of scales, from hill slope to windward and leeward sides of mountain ranges, are simulated by dividing the terrain into topographic facets. A coastal proximity measure is used to account for sharp climatic gradients near coastlines. A 2-layer model structure divides the atmosphere into a lower boundary layer and an upper free atmosphere layer, allowing the simulation of temperature inversions, as well as mid-slope precipitation maxima. The effectiveness of various terrain configurations at producing orographic precipitation enhancement is also estimated. Climate mapping examples are presented.},

  abstract = {Spatial climate data sets of 1971\textendash{}2000 mean monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature were developed for the conterminous United States. These 30-arcsec ({$\sim$}800-m) grids are the official spatial climate data sets of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reflected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate\textendash{}elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reflect the 1971\textendash{}2000 period. PRISM interpolation uncertainties were estimated with cross-validation (C-V) mean absolute error (MAE) and the 70\% prediction interval of the climate\textendash{}elevation regression function. The two measures were not well correlated at the point level, but were similar when averaged over large regions. The PRISM data set was compared with the WorldClim and Daymet spatial climate data sets. The comparison demonstrated that using a relatively dense station data set and the physiographically sensitive PRISM interpolation process resulted in substantially improved climate grids over those of WorldClim and Daymet. The improvement varied, however, depending on the complexity of the region. Mountainous and coastal areas of the western United States, characterized by sparse data coverage, large elevation gradients, rain shadows, inversions, cold air drainage, and coastal effects, showed the greatest improvement. The PRISM data set benefited from a peer review procedure that incorporated local knowledge and data into the development process. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {Cold air drainage and pooling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at night and during winter. Local climate regimes associated with frequent cold air pooling have substantial impacts on species phenology, distribution and diversity. However, little is known about how the degree and frequency of cold air drainage and pooling will respond to a changing climate. Evidence suggests that, because cold pools are decoupled from the free atmosphere, these local climates may not respond in the same way as regional-scale climates estimated from coarse-grid general circulation models. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that historical changes in the frequency of synoptic conditions have produced complex spatial variations in the resulting climatic changes on the ground. In the mountainous terrain of the Oregon Cascades, we show that, at relatively exposed hill slope and ridge top locations, air temperatures are highly coupled to changes in synoptic circulation patterns at the 700-hPa level, whereas in sheltered valley bottoms, cold air pooling at night and during winter causes temperatures to be largely decoupled from, and relatively insensitive to, 700-hPa flow variations. The result is a complex temperature landscape composed of steep gradients in temporal variation, controlled largely by gradients in elevation and topographic position. When a projected climate warming of 2.5 \textdegree{}C was combined with likely changes in the frequency distribution of synoptic circulation, modelled temperature changes at closely spaced locations diverged widely (by up to 6 \textdegree{}C), with differences equalling or exceeding that of the imposed regional temperature change. Because cold air pooling and consequent atmospheric decoupling occur in many mountain valleys, especially at high latitudes, this phenomenon is likely to be an important consideration in understanding the impacts of climate change in mountainous regions.

We demonstrate a strong correlation between present-day forest plant diversity patterns and the location of Roman farm buildings. Plant species richness strongly increases toward the center of the settlements, and the frequency of neutrophilous and nitrogen-demanding species is higher. This pattern is paralleled by an increase in soil pH, available P, and d15N, indicating the long-term impact of former agricultural practices on forest biogeochemical cycles. These extensive observations in a forested region on acid soils complement and confirm previous results from a single Roman settlement on limestone. Ancient Roman agricultural systems are increasingly being identified in contemporary French forests; the broad extent and long-lasting effects of previous cultivation shown in this study require that land-use history be considered as a primary control over biodiversity variations in many forest landscapes, even after millennia of abandonment.},

However, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions. Here, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations. As rates of warming in the Arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in Arctic ecosystems is especially urgent. We established experimentally warmed and nonwarmed common garden plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic with seeds of two forb species (Oxyria digyna and Papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the Arctic. We found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment. Phenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations. Our results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.},

  abstract = {Until now, Quaternary paleoecologists have regarded evolution as a slow process relative to climate change, predicting that the primary biotic response to changing climate is not adaptation, but instead (1) persistence in situ if changing climate remains within the species' tolerance limits, (2) range shifts (migration) to regions where climate is currently within the species' tolerance limits, or (3) extinction. We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions. Collaboration between paleoecologists and evolutionary biologists can refine interpretations of paleorecords, and improve predictions of biotic response to anticipated climate change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quercus oleoides Cham. and Schlect., tropical live oak, is a species of conservation importance in its southern range limit of northwestern Costa Rica. It occurs in high-density stands across a fragmented landscape spanning a contrasting elevation and precipitation gradient. We examined genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure in this geographically isolated and genetically distinct population. We characterized population genetic diversity at 11 nuclear microsatellite loci in 260 individuals from 13 sites. We monitored flowering time at 10 sites, and characterized the local environment in order to compare observed spatial genetic structure to hypotheses of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment. Finally, we quantified pollen dispersal distances and tested for local adaptation through a reciprocal transplant experiment in order to experimentally address these hypotheses.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS: High genetic diversity is maintained in the population and the genetic variation is significantly structured among sampled sites. We identified 5 distinct genetic clusters and average pollen dispersal predominately occurred over short distances. Differences among sites in flowering phenology and environmental factors, however, were not strictly associated with genetic differentiation. Growth and survival of upland and lowland progeny in their native and foreign environments was expected to exhibit evidence of local adaptation due to the more extreme dry season in the lowlands. Seedlings planted in the lowland garden experienced much higher mortality than seedlings in the upland garden, but we did not identify evidence for local adaptation.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSION: Overall, this study indicates that the Costa Rican Q. oleoides population has a rich population genetic history. Despite environmental heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation, isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment alone do not explain spatial genetic structure. These results add to studies of genetic structure by examining a common, tropical tree over multiple habitats and provide information for managers of a successional forest in a protected area.},

Different causes for stable polymorphism or species coexistence have already been identified but they can be grouped into a limited number of general processes. This article is devoted to the presentation and illustration of a new process, which we call 'habitat boundary polymorphism', and which relies on two key ingredients: habitat heterogeneity and distance-limited dispersal. Under direct competition and with fixed population densities, we show that this process allows for the equilibrium coexistence of more than n types in a n-habitat environment. Distance-limited dispersal indeed creates local maladaptation at habitat edges, which leaves room for the invasion of more generalist alleles or species. This mechanism provides a generic yet neglected process for the maintenance of polymorphism or species coexistence.},

When a population is subdivided into demes with selection toward different local optima, migration between demes may result in asymmetric, or skewed, local distributions. Using a simplified two-habitat model, we derive formulas without a priori assuming a Gaussian distribution of genotypic values, and we find expressions that naturally incorporate higher moments, such as skew. These formulas yield predictions of the expected divergence under migration-selection balance that are more accurate than models assuming Gaussian distributions, which illustrates the importance of incorporating these higher moments to assess the response to selection in heterogeneous environments. We further show with simulations that traits with loci of large effect display the largest skew in their distribution at migration-selection balance.

  abstract = {Slow-colonizing forest understorey plants are probably not able to rapidly adjust their distribution range following largescale climate change. Therefore, the acclimation potential to climate change within their actual occupied habitats will likely be key for their short- and long-term persistence. We combined transplant experiments along a latitudinal gradient with open-top chambers to assess the effects of temperature on phenology, growth and reproductive performance of multiple populations of slow-colonizing understorey plants, using the spring flowering geophytic forb Anemone nemorosa and the early summer flowering grass Milium effusum as study species. In both species, emergence time and start of flowering clearly advanced with increasing temperatures. Vegetative growth (plant height, aboveground biomass) and reproductive success (seed mass, seed germination and germinable seed output) of A. nemorosa benefited from higher temperatures. Climate warming may thus increase future competitive ability and colonization rates of this species. Apart from the effects on phenology, growth and reproductive performance of M. effusum generally decreased when transplanted southwards (e.g., plant size and number of individuals decreased towards the south) and was probably more limited by light availability in the south. Specific leaf area of both species increased when transplanted southwards, but decreased with open-top chamber installation in A. nemorosa. In general, individuals of both species transplanted at the home site performed best, suggesting local adaptation. We conclude that contrasting understorey plants may display divergent plasticity in response to changing temperatures which may alter future understorey community dynamics.},

Despite their ecological and economic importance, conifers seemed long out of reach for complete genome sequencing, due in part to their enormous genome size (20-30 Gb) and the highly repetitive nature of their genomes. Technological advances in genome sequencing and assembly enabled the recent publication of three conifer genomes: white spruce (Picea glauca), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). These genome sequences revealed distinctive features compared with other plant genomes and may represent a window into the past of seed plant genomes.

Many hybridizing species have porous genomes with regions impermeable to introgression, conferring reproductive barriers between species. We used ecological niche modelling to study the glacial and postglacial recolonization patterns between the widely hybridizing spruce species Picea glauca and P. engelmannii in western North America. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 311 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 290 genes were used to assess levels of admixture and introgression and to identify loci putatively involved in adaptive differences or reproductive barriers between species. Our palaeoclimatic modelling suggests that these two closely related species have a long history of hybridization and introgression, dating to at least 21,000 years ago, yet species integrity is maintained by a combination of strong environmental selection and reduced current interspecific gene flow. Twenty loci showed evidence of divergent selection, including six loci that were both Fst outliers and associated with climatic gradients, and fourteen loci that were either outliers or showed associations with climate. These included genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction and transcription factors.},

  abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species},

We estimated nBR R2 component area-under-the-curve as well as PREP amplitude habituation as the slope pof the linear regression between the 1st and the 2nd block of 5 averaged responses.ResultsFollowing 1-month on KD, the mean number of attacks and headache duration reduced significantly. Moreover, KD significantly normalized the interictal PREP habituation (pre: + 1.8, post: - 9.1, p = 0.012), while nBR deficit of habituation did not change.ConclusionsThe positive clinical effects we observed in a population of migraineurs by a 1-month KD treatment coexists with a normalization at the cortical level, not in the brainstem, of the typical interictal deficit of habituation.

This method combines the interpolation of daily ratios/fractions derived from ground-based meteorological station records and respective fields of monthly estimates. Data sources for the described implementation over the conterminous United States (CONUS) are two independent and quality-controlled inputs: 1) an enhanced compilation of daily observations derived from the National Climatic Data Center digital archives and 2) the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) maps. The results of this study show that this nonconventional interpolation preserves the spatial and temporal distribution of both the PRISM maps (monthly, topography-sensitive patterns) and the original daily observations. Statistics of a preliminary point comparison with the observed values at high-quality and independent reference sites show a reasonable agreement and a noticeable improvement over the nearest station method in orographically sensitive areas. The implemented datasets provide daily precipitation and temperature values at 2.5-min (around 4 km) resolution for 1960-2001. Combining seamless spatial and temporal coverage and topographic sensitivity characteristics, the datasets offer the potential for supporting current and future regional and historical hydrologic assessments over the CONUS.

The scheme links the environment, pathways, traits, and genes, and highlights the selective forces that shape and maintain migratory adaptation. We endorse an individual-based behavioral definition of migration that allows an objective distinction between migration and other forms of movement. We recognize migration as an adaptation to resources that fluctuate spatiotemporally either seasonally or less predictably, and note that it is often preemptive. Migration plays a central role in the spatial dynamics of mobile populations, and is largely distinct in both form and function from the within-population mixing arising from postnatal dispersal and from the interpatch movements characteristic of metapopulations. We call for more interaction between biologists studying different taxa and different forms of movement, and between behaviorists and population ecologists.},

Despite the abundance, richness and ecological importance of insects, distribution patterns remain unknown for most groups, and this creates serious diffi- culties for the evaluation of macroecological patterns and the underlying drivers. Although the problem is real, we provide an optimistic perspective on insect macroe- cology and conservation biogeography. 2. Although data for macroecological analysis of insects are not as complete as for many other organisms (e.g., mammals and birds), at least for some insect groups they are equivalent to what existed 10 or 20 years ago for the charismatic mega- fauna, so initiatives to compile data for broad-scale analyses are feasible. 3. The primary constraint for studies in insect macroecology and conservation biogeography is not (only) poor data; part of the problem arises from a lack of knowledge on how macroecological patterns and processes can be analysed and interpreted. 4. Finally, we present an overview of recent papers using insects as model organ- isms in macroecology, including richness and diversity gradients, ecogeographical rules, inter-specific relationships, conservation planning and modelling species distri- butions. Although our list is not exhaustive, it may be useful as guidelines for future research and encourage ICD readers to develop analyses for other insect groups.},

However, although many species' ranges have shifted in historical times, many others have not, or have shifted only at the high-latitude or high-elevation limits, leading to range expansions rather than contractions. Given these idiosyncratic responses to climate warming, and their varied implications for species' vulnerability to climate change, a critical task is to understand why some species have not shifted their ranges, particularly at the equatorial or low-elevation limits, and whether such resilience will last as warming continues. Here we show that compensatory changes in demographic rates are buffering southern populations of two North American tundra plants against the negative effects of a warming climate, slowing their northward range shifts, but that this buffering is unlikely to continue indefinitely. Southern populations of both species showed lower survival and recruitment but higher growth of individual plants, possibly owing to longer, warmer growing seasons. Because of these and other compensatory changes, the population growth rates of southern populations are not at present lower than those of northern ones. However, continued warming may yet prove detrimental, as most demographic rates that improved in moderately warmer years declined in the warmest years, with the potential to drive future population declines. Our results emphasize the need for long-term, range-wide measurement of all population processes to detect demographic compensation and to identify nonlinear responses that may lead to sudden range shifts as climatic tipping points are exceeded.},

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of each phase of migraine has evolved over recent years. The premonitory phase begins as early as 3 days before the headache phase, and involves a complex interplay between various cortical and subcortical brain regions, including the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei that modulate nociceptive signaling. The headache phase involves activation of the trigeminovascular system, a pathway that is well characterized. In onethird of patients, an aura phase may occur during some attacks and likely correlates with a cortical spreading depression-like event; a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial cell depolarization and hyperpolarization. Improved characterization of the pathophysiological processes involved at each stage of the migraine attack will aid the identification of new therapeutic targets for migraine prevention. This review provides an update on prevailing concepts of migraine pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary branching occurs when frequency-depen- dent selection splits a phenotypically monomorphic population into two distinct phenotypic clusters. A prerequisite for evolutionary branching is that directional selection drives the population toward a fitness minimum in phenotype space. This article demonstrates that selection regimes leading to evolutionary branching readily arise from a wide variety of different ecological interactions within and between species. We use classical ecological models for symmetric and asymmetric competition, for mutualism, and for predator-prey interactions to describe evolving populations with continuously vary- ing characters. For these models, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching and establish that branching is a generic and robust phenomenon. Evo- lutionary branching becomes a model for sympatric speciation when population genetics and mating mechanisms are incorporated into ecological models. In sexual populations with random mating, the continual production of intermediate phenotypes from two incipient branches prevents evolutionary branching. In contrast, when mating is assortative for the ecological characters under study, evolutionary branching is possible in sexual populations and can lead to speciation. Therefore, we also study the evolution of assortative mating as a quantitative character.We show that evolution under branching con- ditions selects for assortativeness and thus allows sexual populations to escape from fitness minima. We conclude that evolutionary branching offers a general basis for understanding adaptive speciation and radiation under a wide range of different ecological conditions.},

We previously conducted a systematic review from 2008-2010 to collate and synthesise evidence regarding the relationship between these different types of structural connectivity and the actual movement of native Australian plants and animals (i.e., functional connectivity). Our previous review produced a number of management recommendations but also identified significant knowledge gaps.

  abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {$>$}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

The surprising disparity between the pollen and macrofossil results has important implications for paleomigration research. These results imply that the use of assigned pollen percentages to indicate the presence of a species within a region may not be valid, particularly where a species is at the edge of its geographic range. Comparison of the timing of the first appearance of lodgepole pine pollen from a dozaen sections along the north Pacific coast suggests either a late Wisconsin refugium for this pine in southeastern Alaska or extremely rapid lateglacial coastal migretion northwestward following ice retreat.},

Moreover, despite widespread concern about changes in species' global distributions, it remains unclear if and how such large-scale changes may affect this relationship. We present a new conceptual model of how invasive species might modulate relationships between primary production and species richness. We tested this model using long-term data on relationships between aboveground net primary production and species richness in six North American terrestrial ecosystems. We show that primary production and abundance of non-native species are both significant predictors of species richness, though we fail to detect effects of invasion extent on the shapes of the relationship between species richness and primary production.},

Recent geophysical data as well as theoretical models suggest that, to the contrary, both oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations have changed dramatically during defining periods of metazoan evolution. Hyperoxia in the late Paleozoic atmosphere may have physiologically enhanced the initial evolution of tetrapod locomotor energetics; a concurrently hyperdense atmosphere would have augmented aerodynamic force production in early flying insects. Multiple historical origins of vertebrate flight also correlate temporally with geological periods of increased oxygen concentration and atmospheric density. Arthropod as well as amphibian gigantism appear to have been facilitated by a hyperoxic Carboniferous atmosphere and were subsequently eliminated by a late Permian transition to hypoxia. For extant organisms, the transient, chronic and ontogenetic effects of exposure to hyperoxic gas mixtures are poorly understood relative to contemporary understanding of the physiology of oxygen deprivation. Experimentally, the biomechanical and physiological effects of hyperoxia on animal flight performance can be decoupled through the use of gas mixtures that vary in density and oxygen concentration. Such manipulations permit both paleophysiological simulation of ancestral locomotor performance and an analysis of maximal flight capacity in extant forms.},

We study how adaptation affects range shifts when it involves multiple quantitative traits evolving in response to local selection pressures and gene flow. All traits develop clines shifting in space, some of which may be in a direction opposite to univariate predictions, and the species tracks its environmental optimum with a constant lag. We provide analytical expressions for the local density and average trait values. A species can sustain faster environmental shifts, develop a wider range and greater local adaptation when spatial environmental variation is low (generating low migration load) and multitrait adaptive potential is high. These conditions are favoured when nonlinear (stabilising) selection is weak in the phenotypic direction of the change in optimum, and genetic variation is high in the phenotypic direction of the selection gradient.},

In long-lived organisms such as trees, genetic adaptation is slow, and how much phenotypic plasticity can help them cope with climate change remains largely unknown. Here, we assess whether, where and when phenological plasticity is and will be adaptive in three major European tree species. We use a process-based species distribution model, parameterized with extensive ecological data, and manipulate plasticity to suppress phenological variations due to interannual, geographical and trend climate variability, under current and projected climatic conditions. We show that phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and mostly affects fitness at the margins of the species' distribution and climatic niche. Under current climatic conditions, phenological plasticity constrains the northern range limit of oak and beech and the southern range limit of pine. Under future climatic conditions, phenological plasticity becomes strongly adaptive towards the trailing edges of beech and oak, but severely constrains the range and niche of pine. Our results call for caution when interpreting geographical variation in trait means as adaptive, and strongly point towards species distribution models explicitly taking phenotypic plasticity into account when forecasting species distribution under climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {Based on the atmospheric turbulence diffusion model, a three-dimensional numerical model was applied for predicting the cross-pollination rate distribution in leeward area of windbreaks by considering actual weather observation data, daily fluctuation parameter of pollen release rate, pollen life during flowering period, etc. Several cases of cross-pollination effect of windbreak distributions in the field were simulated. It is demonstrated that windbreak nets and windbreaks plant or forest are effective in suppressing pollen dispersal and cross-pollination. By simulating pollen diffusion under actual weather conditions using this model, it is possible to evaluate the effect of cross-pollination by the windbreak facilities and give advises of how to set windbreaks for suppressing crossing.},

By analysing the 'climate paths' that range shifts might follow, and two key range-shift processes--dispersal and population persistence--we show that short-term climatic and population characteristics have dramatic effects on range-shift forecasts. By employing this approach with 15 amphibian species in the western USA, we make unexpected predictions. First, inter-decadal variability in climate change can prevent range shifts by causing gaps in climate paths, even in the absence of geographic barriers. Second, the hitherto unappreciated trait of persistence during unfavourable climatic conditions is critical to species range shifts. Third, climatic fluctuations and low persistence could lead to endangerment even if the future potential range size is large. These considerations may render habitat corridors ineffectual for some species, and conservationists may need to consider managed relocation and augmentation of in situ populations.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in quantifying genetic population structure across the geographical ranges of species to understand why species might exhibit stable range limits and to assess the conservation value of peripheral populations. However, many assertions regarding peripheral populations rest on the long-standing but poorly tested supposition that peripheral populations exhibit low genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation as a consequence of smaller effective population size and greater geographical isolation relative to geographically central populations. We reviewed 134 studies representing 115 species that tested for declines in within-population genetic diversity and/or increases in among-population differentiation towards range margins using nuclear molecular genetic markers. On average, 64.2\% of studies detected the expected decline in diversity, 70.2\% of those that tested for it showed increased differentiation and there was a positive association between these trends. In most cases, however, the difference in genetic diversity between central and peripheral population was not large. Although these results were consistent across plants and animals, strong taxonomic and biogeographical biases in the available studies call for a cautious generalization of these results. Despite the large number of studies testing these simple predictions, very few attempted to test possible mechanisms causing reduced peripheral diversity or increased differentiation. Almost no study incorporated a phylogeographical framework to evaluate historical influences on contemporary genetic patterns. Finally, there has been little effort to test whether these geographical trends in putatively neutral variation at marker loci are reflected by quantitative genetic trait variation, which is likely to influence the adaptive potential of populations across the geographical range.},

Here, we review and compare various sources of such non-random gene flow, and summarize its effects on local adaptation and resource use, metapopulation dynamics, adaptation to climate change, biological invasion, and speciation.

  abstract = {Global climate change is expected to produce large shifts in vegetation distribution and has already increased tree mortality, altering forest structure. However, long-term shifts will be partly dependent on the ability of species to reproduce under a novel climate. Few studies have examined the impact of climate change on the reproductive output of long-lived 'masting' species, or species characterized by episodic reproductive events. Here, we show that seed cone production among pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), a masting species, declined by 40\% from the 1974 decade (1969-1978) to the 2008 decade (2003-2012) in revisited stands throughout New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma. Seed cone production was highly correlated with late summer temperatures at the time of cone initiation. Further, declines in seed cone production were greatest among populations that experienced the greatest increases in growing season temperatures, which were the populations located at the cooler, upper elevations. As growing season temperatures are predicted to increase across this region over the next century, these findings suggest seed cone production may be an increasingly important bottleneck for future pinyon pine regeneration, especially in areas with greater increases in temperature. Declines in seed cone production may not only affect pinyon pine population dynamics but also the various wildlife species that rely on pinyon pine seeds. Because pinyon pine has similar reproductive strategies as other semi-arid pine species, increasing temperature may negatively influence reproductive output of other conifers. Further investigation into the full geographic and taxonomic extent of these seed declines is warranted.},

Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

Genomic markers can now be developed for non-model species using reduced representation library (RRL) sequencing methods that select a fraction of the genome using targeted sequence capture or restriction enzymes (genotyping-by-sequencing, GBS). We explored the influence of marker number and length, knowledge of gametic phase, and tradeoffs between sample size and sequencing depth on the quality of demographic inferences performed with ABC. We focused on 2-population models of recent spatial expansion with varying numbers of unknown parameters. Performing ABC on simulated datasets with known parameter values, we found that the timing of a recent spatial expansion event could be precisely estimated in a 3-parameter model. Taking into account uncertainty in parameters such as initial population size and migration rate collectively decreased the precision of inferences dramatically. Phasing haplotypes did not improve results, regardless of sequence length. Numerous short sequences were as valuable as fewer, longer sequences, and performed best when a large sample size was sequenced at low individual depth, even when sequencing errors were added. ABC results were similar to results obtained with an alternative method based on the site frequency spectrum (SFS) when performed with unphased GBS-type markers. We conclude that unphased GBS-type datasets can be sufficient to precisely infer simple demographic models, and discuss possible improvements for the use of ABC with genomic data.},

We combined 500 yr of tree-ring and genotyping-by-sequencing data in 639 trees at the expansion front on the Kodiak Archipelago. We show that alleles accumulated rapidly during an increase in recruitment rate in the early 1700s. A shift from foreign to local pollen flow subsequently homogenized genetic structure at the expansion front. Taking advantage of the exceptional longevity of conifers, we highlight the major role of long-distance pollen dispersal in the rapid but incomplete recovery of genetic diversity during the initial stages of colonization. We also warn that slow initial population growth as well as long-lasting dominance of local gene flow by early founders could increase evolutionary load under a rapidly changing climate.},

  abstract = {Although theory has demonstrated rather low levels of gene flow are sufficient to counteract opposing mutation, drift, and selection, widespread recognition of the evolutionary importance of gene flow has come slowly. The perceived role of gene flow as an evolutionary force has vacillated over the last century. In the last few decades, new methods and analyses have demonstrated that plant gene flow rates vary tremendously-from nil to very high-depending on the species and specific populations involved, and sometimes over time for individual populations. In many cases, the measured gene flow rates are evolutionarily significant at distances of hundreds and sometimes thousands of meters, occurring at levels sufficient to counteract drift, spread advantageous alleles, or thwart moderate levels of opposing local selection. Gene flow in plants is likely to often act as a cohesive force, uniting individual plant species into real evolutionary units. Also, gene flow can evolve under natural selection, decreasing or increasing. The fact of frequent, but variable, plant gene flow has important consequences for applied issues in which the presence or absence of gene flow might influence the outcome of a policy, regulatory, or management decision. Examples include the unintended spread of engineered genes, the evolution of invasiveness, and conservation. New data-rich genomic techniques allow closer scrutiny of the role of gene flow in plant evolution. Most plant evolutionists now recognize the importance of gene flow, and it is receiving increased recognition from other areas of plant biology as well.},

This Article claims that the model, like all social construction accounts, has essentially no policy implications. Its impact depends on normative commitments developed by some other logic, such as membership in the disability rights movement or adherence to versions of libertarian, utilitarian, or egalitarian theory that are triggered by the models causation story. At the same time, a normative framework within which the social model is relevant will suggest not only policy goals but also an institutional design. These points are illustrated by recent controversies involving genetic screening technology, cochlear implants, and sign language communities. Contrary to impressions left in the law literature, the social model has nothing to say about the proper response to such developments, although the model might have a mediated influence on our sense of the best decisionmakers.},

A list of critera is suggested to help identification of remnant plant populations. Several community and ecosystem features may result from the presence of remnant plant populations. Apart from increasing community and ecosystem resilience just by being present, remnant populations may contribute to resilience through enhancing colonization by other plant species, by providing a persistent habitat for assemblages of animals and microorganisms, and by reducing variation in nutrient cycling. It is suggested that the common ability of plants to develop remnant populations is a contributing factor to ecosystem stability. Remnant populations are important for the capacity of ecosystems to cope with the present-day impact caused by human society, and their occurrence should be recognized in surveys of threatened plant species and communities.},

  abstract = {Detecting ``extra-local'' pollen, and especially long-distance transport events, in fossil pollen data is a problematical task, particularly when one species dominates both the vegetation and the pollen counts, as is the case with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Fennoscandia. As a step towards elucidating this, modern airborne pollen data were analysed in northern Finland along a north\textendash{}south transect (Kevo north of the pine forest limit, and Rovaniemi and Oulu within the pine forest) for the years 1977\textendash{}2008 (Kevo), 2002\textendash{}2008 (Rovaniemi) and 1997\textendash{}2008 (Oulu). By using phenological observations, the ``extra-local'' (``preflowering'') pine pollen, occurring before the onset of local male flowering, could be detected. Preflowering pine pollen represents only that ``extra-local'' pollen deposited before the onset of local pollen shedding and, therefore, underestimates the annual ``extra-local'' pine pollen amount. For Kevo a maximum estimation of total ``extra-local'' pine pollen could be calculated, which was 34\%. The preflowering values nevertheless provide a minimum estimation of total ``extra-local'' pine pollen, because, within the period studied, the pollen shedding onset dates at the three sites were delayed in a northwards direction by, on average, 8\textendash{}9days from one study site to the next, which was mostly longer than the duration of local flowering. Kevo had the lowest total pine pollen values due to its position north of the pine forest limit, of which 11\% was preflowering. The highest average total pine pollen values and 15\% preflowering were found at Rovaniemi, while Oulu had the smallest amount of preflowering pollen (6\%) but a high total pine pollen sum. Rovaniemi and Kevo had several years with more than 10\% preflowering pollen. The variation in preflowering data was highest at Kevo. In five years, its percentage was remarkably high ({$>$}20\%) and occurred at least two weeks before the local male flowering onset, suggesting a pollen source further away. Clear long-distance transport events could be detected at Kevo in 2001 and 2008. In the 2001 event, the wind came from southerly directions, so the possible pollen source was in southern Finland several hundred km to the south. The amount of ``extra-local'' preflowering pine pollen is on average only 6 to 15\% of total pine pollen at the northern Finnish sites, and much of it would seem to originate from sources closer to the site than expected. These average preflowering pine pollen percentages provide a minimum estimation of the proportion of pollen originating from ``extra-local'' sources, which can be applied to fossil pollen data, where one sample comprises several years.},

  abstract = {Climate, habitat, and species interactions are factors that control community properties (e.g., species richness, abundance) across various spatial scales. Usually, researchers study how a few properties are affected by one factor in isolation and at one scale. Hence, there are few multi-scale studies testing how multiple controlling factors simultaneously affect community properties at different scales. We ask whether climate, habitat structure, or insect resources at each of three spatial scales explains most of the variation in six community properties and which theory best explains the distribution of selected community properties across a rainfall gradient. We studied a Neotropical insectivorous bat ensemble in the Isthmus of Panama with acoustic monitoring techniques. Using climatological data, habitat surveys, and insect captures in a hierarchical sampling design we determined how much variation of the community properties was explained by the three factors employing two approaches for variance partitioning. Our results revealed that most of the variation in species richness, total abundance, and feeding activity occurred at the smallest spatial scale and was explained by habitat structure. In contrast, climate at large scales explained most of the variation in individual species' abundances. Although each species had an idiosyncratic response to the gradient, species richness peaked at intermediate levels of precipitation, whereas total abundance was very similar across sites, suggesting density compensation. All community properties responded in a different manner to the factor and scale under consideration.},

Following the instigation of conservation measures, black grouse in England have increased in numbers from 773 males in 1998 to 1029 males in 2006, but their range has not expanded. Range expansion may be limited by the low dispersal rates of male black grouse, with yearling males dispersing on average 0.8 km, compared to 9.3 km by females. To expand the range of black grouse into suitable habitats on the fringe of their range we commenced a translocation trial in the winter of 2006/7. Two release sites were selected which were considered to have suitable habitat to sustain a lekking group, had full time predator controllers operating and were within the dispersal range of yearling females. Thirteen males equipped with radio transmitters were released, eight at one site, five at the other. All were observed lekking and females were subsequently seen at both release sites.},

The challenge for organisms is to construct phenotypes using the most accurate environmental cue. 2. Here, we use a quantitative genetic model of adaptation by additive genetic variance, within- and transgenerational plasticity via linear reaction norms and indirect genetic effects to model maternal inheritance and phenotypic plasticity, respectively. 3. We show how the relative influence on the eventual phenotype of these components depends on the predictability of environmental change (fast or slow, sinusoidal or stochastic) and the developmental lag {$\tau$} between when the environment is perceived and when selection acts. 4. We then decompose expected mean fitness into three components (variance load, adaptation, fluctuation load) to study the fitness costs of within- and transgenerational plasticity. A strongly negative maternal effect coefficient m minimises the variance load, but a strongly positive m minimises the fluctuation load. The adaptation term is maximised closer to zero, with positive or negative m preferred under different environmental scenarios. 5. Phenotypic plasticity is higher when {$\tau$} is shorter and when the environment changes frequently between seasonal extremes. Expected mean population fitness is highest away from highest obtained levels of phenotypic plasticity. 6. Within- and transgenerational plasticity act in concert to deliver well-adapted phenotypes, which emphasises the need to study both simultaneously when investigating phenotypic evolution.

  abstract = {The conservation and sustainable use of forests in the twenty-first century pose huge challenges for forest management and policy. Society demands that forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, from timber products, raw materials and renewable energy to sociocultural amenities and habitats for nature conservation. Innovative management and policy approaches need to be developed to meet these often-conflicting demands in a context of environmental change of uncertain magnitude and scale. Genetic diversity is a key component of resilience and adaptability. Overall, forest tree populations are genetically very diverse, conferring them an enormous potential for genetic adaptation via the processes of gene flow and natural selection. Here, we review the main challenges facing our forests in the coming century and focus on how recent progress in genetics can contribute to the development of appropriate practical actions that forest managers and policy makers can adopt to promote forest resilience to climate change. Emerging knowledge will inform and clarify current controversies relating to the choice of appropriate genetic resources for planting, the effect of silvicultural systems and stand tending on adaptive potential and the best ways to harness genetic diversity in breeding and conservation programs. Gaps in our knowledge remain, and we identify where additional information is needed (e.g., the adaptive value of peripheral populations or the genetic determinism of key adaptive traits) and the types of studies that are required to provide this key understanding.},

Accurate estimation of LAI is important for monitoring vegetation dynamics, and LAI information is essentially required for the prediction of microclimate and various biophysical processes within and below canopy. The traditional, direct and destructive method of measuring LAI is time-consuming. Modern gap fraction technique can assess LAI fast and easily, however its application is problematic with vegetations of low stature. Alternatively, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) as a widely used spectral reflectance index has been shown to be a good estimator of LAI and is used to estimate LAI indirectly. In situ measurements of NDVI and LAI at three sites in semi-arid grassland in Inner Mongolia, China were carried out during the growing season in 2005 and 2006. Based on these sites, a general linear and a general exponential relationship (LAI = -0.0897 + 1.424 * NDVI, R = 0.79; LAI = 0.128 * exp(NDVI/0.311), R = 0.77) were developed, which can be used for various grazing intensity grasslands and also for higher vegetation cover area (e.g. wetland) in the region. These equations for estimating LAI are suitable for the natural range of vegetation in this area during the growing season under both normal and dry weather conditions. By simply applying NDVI measurements and these relationships, the vegetation status and grass yield in the area will be rapidly and nondestructively estimated, which is helpful for livestock management and sustainable land use. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

The results can be disappointment when maps are less accurate than expected or incorrect decisions when they are treated as truth. In this paper, we discuss several key issues which are critical to ensuring the effectiveness and value of remote sensing products, but which are also sometimes sources of confusion: (1) direct versus indirect models of land surface properties and processes, (2) differences between class-based and continuous mapping models, (3) scale, and (4) accuracy assessment. We illustrate our points with examples from the application of satellite imagery to forest management issues in the Pacific Northwest, USA.

In short, amplification, homogenization, and indirect effects demonstrate the influence of the indirect flows in a system to show that energy or matter cycling allows flow to return to the same component many times and tend to become evenly distributed within the network. Synergism relates direct and indirect, qualitative relations to show that network organization is, on the whole, more mutualistic than is apparent from direct interactions alone. Using network analysis, objects can be studied as part of a connected system and the indirect effects can be identified and quantified. This is a fundamentally different way of investigating ecosystems, and it gives a quantitative foundation to the widely held perception of the interconnectedness of nature.},

However, studying how wind-mediated movements actually happen has been hampered so far by the lack of high resolution global wind data as well as the impossibility to track aerial movements. Using concurrent data on winds and actual pathways of a tracked seabird, here we show that oceanic winds define spatiotemporal pathways and barriers for large-scale aerial movements. We obtained wind data from NASA SeaWinds scatterometer to calculate wind cost (impedance) models reflecting the resistance to the aerial movement near the ocean surface. We also tracked the movements of a model organism, the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), a pelagic bird known to perform long distance migrations. Cost models revealed that distant areas can be connected through "wind highways" that do not match the shortest great circle routes. Bird routes closely followed the low-cost "wind-highways" linking breeding and wintering areas. In addition, we found that a potential barrier, the near surface westerlies in the Atlantic sector of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), temporally hindered meridional trans-equatorial movements. Once the westerlies vanished, birds crossed the ITCZ to their winter quarters. This study provides a novel approach to investigate wind-mediated movements in oceanic environments and shows that large-scale migration and dispersal processes over the oceans can be largely driven by spatiotemporal wind patterns.},

This has been studied intensively using controlled experiments, but it has been difficult to scale short-term observations to long-term ecosystem-level response. This paper derives variations of plant intrinsic water-use efficiency from natural trees for the past 100-200 years using carbon isotope chronologies. This parameter may potentially cause an increase in plant growth rate by improving the efficiency of plant water use, especially in arid environments. Attempts were made to isolate variations of intrinsic water-use efficiency as a function of only the CO2concentration of the atmosphere. The intrinsic water-use efficiency of almost all trees increased with increasing atmospheric CO2concentration. This is caused by an increase in the carbon assimilation rate (A) and/or a decrease in the stomatal conductance (g). The increase in plant intrinsic water-use efficiency may imply an increase in plant transpiration efficiency which may have a direct connection with changes in plant biomass.},

  abstract = {The coarse-scale population structure of pathogenic Armillaria (Fr.) Staude species was determined on approximately 16 100 ha of relatively dry, mixed-conifer forest in the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon. Sampling of recently dead or live, symptomatic conifers produced 112 isolates of Armillaria from six tree species. Armillaria species identifications done by using a polymerase chain reaction based diagnostic and diploid\textendash{}diploid pairings produced identical results: 108 of the isolates were Armillaria ostoyae (Romagn.) Herink and four were North American Biological Species X (NABS X). Five genets of A. ostoyae and one of NABS X were identified through the use of somatic incompatibility pairings among the putatively diploid isolates. Armillaria ostoyae genet sizes were approximately 20, 95, 195, 260, and 965 ha; cumulative colonization of the study area was at least 9.5\%. The maximum distance between isolates from the 965-ha A. ostoyae genet was approximately 3810 m, and use of three estimates of A. ostoyae spread rate in conifer forests resulted in age estimates for the genet ranging from 1900 to 8650 years. Results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms that influenced the establishment, expansion, and expression of these genets; the genetic structure and stability of Armillaria; and the implications for disease management in this and similar forests.},

Our study focuses on how genetic variation in a dominant riparian tree ( Populus fremontii, P. angustifolia and their natural F(1) and backcross hybrids) affects whole-tree water use, and its potential ecosystem implications. Three major patterns were found. First, in a 12-year-old common garden with trees of known genetic makeup, hybrids had elevated daily integrated leaf-specific transpiration ( E(tl); P=0.013) and average canopy conductance ( G(c); P=0.037), with both E(tl) and G(c) approximately 30\% higher in hybrid cross types than parental types. Second, delta(13)C values of leaves from these same trees were significantly more negative in hybrids ( P=0.004), and backcross hybrids had significantly more negative values than all other F(1) hybrid and parental types ( P{$<$}0.001). Third, in the wild, a similar pattern was found in leaf delta(13)C values where both hybrid cross types had the lowest values ( P{$<$}0.001) and backcross hybrids had lower delta(13)C values than any other tree type ( P{$<$}0.001). Our findings have two important implications: (1). the existence of a consistent genetic difference in whole-tree physiology suggests that whole-tree gas and water exchange could be another pathway through which genes could affect ecosystems; and (2). such studies are important because they seek to quantify the genetic variation that exists in basic physiological processes-such knowledge could ultimately place ecosystem studies within a genetic framework.},

However, most efforts to model the response of species to climate change ignore intraspecific variation due to local adapta-tion. Here, we present a new perspective on spatial modelling of organism\textendash{}environment relation-ships that combines genomic data and community-level modelling to develop scenarios regarding the geographic distribution of genomic variation in response to environmental change. Rather than modelling species within communities, we use these techniques to model large numbers of loci across genomes. Using balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can accommodate nonlinear responses of loci to environmental gradients. We identify a threshold response to temperature in the circadian clock gene GIGANTEA-5 (GI5), sug-gesting that this gene has experienced strong local adaptation to temperature. We also demon-strate how these methods can map ecological adaptation from genomic data, including the identification of predicted differences in the genetic composition of populations under current and future climates. Community-level modelling of genomic variation represents an important advance in landscape genomics and spatial modelling of biodiversity that moves beyond species-level assessments of climate change vulnerability.},

However, some authors suggest that both species are potentially able to maintain their populations in the distribution area of the other species. Reciprocal transplant experiments in two mountain localities (one with A. alpinum, the other with A. odoratum) were carried out to study the survival and vegetative and generative reproduction of tussocks of both species in the area of distribution of the other species. The mortality of tussocks of A. alpinum was higher in the "alien"locality, the life span of tillers was greatly reduced and the size of tussocks decreased considerably duringthe experiment compared to its "native"locality. These results suggest thatthere was a lack of favourable microsites for A. alpinum in the "alien" locality probably caused by the presence of strong competitors. A. odoratum flowered far less in the "alien" locality (both on tussocks and tillers) compared to the "native" one. These results suggest that environmental conditions are not suitable for the flowering of A. odoratum in the "alien" locality. We conclude thatA. alpinum could have been limited in extending its distributioninto the areaof A. odoratum by the presence of strong competitors, while A. odoratum could have been limited by its ability to reproduce by seed.},

This level of segregation was further increased when morphological measurements and counts of insect galls were analyzed simultaneously. We interpret this result to mean that plant morphology and insect distributions reflect two different, perhaps overlapping, portions of the host's genome. By using both sets of characters concurrently, rather than either set independently, we increased the portion of the plant's genome being sampled and increased the probability of detecting differences among host genotypes. Hence, knowledge of the distributions of insect galls may be useful for augmenting the level of separation, obtained by morphological measurements, among intrapopulational categories of plant genotypes. This application may be of greatest benefit when hybridization blurs morphological distinctions among plant taxa, when morphological traits are highly variable within genotypes, or when ephemeral morphological traits (e.g., leaves, flowers) are not available for measurements.},

Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology \textendash{} temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod \textendash{} generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work suggests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst (-15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout (-19.1 and -11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

  abstract = {The Cactus-Microorganism-Drosophila Model System of the Sonoran Desert represents an excellent paradigm of the role of chemistry in plant-animal interactions. In this system, four species of endemic Drosophila feed and reproduce in necrotic tissue of five species of columnar cacti. Studies over the past 35 yr have characterized a myriad of interactions between the three major components of the model system. The cacti contain a variety of allelochemicals which are primarily responsible for the highly specific pattern of host plant utilization exhibited by the desert Drosophila. Plant chemistry, through its effect on the microbially produced volatile patterns, is further involved in host specificity because the flies use the volatile pattern to cue in on necroses in the appropriate species of cactus. The metabolic activities of microorganisms (bacteria and yeasts) living in the necrosis can affect the substrate chemistry in both positive and negative ways (i.e., acting to increase or to decrease the toxicity of the substrate). Finally, cactus chemistry may affect drosophilid mating behavior since larval rearing substrate has been shown to influence adult hydrocarbon epicuticular composition. In D. mojavensis, adult hydrocarbon profile has been implicated as a determinant of mate choice leading to premating isolation between geographically isolated populations that use chemically different cactus substrates. Current research is focused on the evolution and regulation of genes whose products (cytochrome P450 enzymes) are involved in the specific insect-host plant relationships which exist between the Drosophila species and the cactus species.There are many reasons why investigators choose to focus their research efforts on what are referred to as ``model systems.'' Typically included among these would be the idea that model systems are easier to study because they are less complex than other scientific situations. At the same time, model systems should be representative of more complex, natural systems so that information that is obtained from their study is broadly applicable. For almost a century, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has served as a model organism for the study of genetics. As a genetic paradigm, Drosophila is more tractable to scientific investigation than most organisms and has provided important insights into a wide variety of human maladies from alcohol abuse to neurological brain disorders (Bellen, 1998). Similarly, the interrelationships of the columnar cacti and the cactophilic Drosophila species of the Sonoran Desert have, for the past 35 yr, provided an excellent model system with which to study relevant questions in evolution, ecological genetics, and chemical ecology. The intent of this article is to briefly review and characterize the chemical interactions between the plants (cacti) and animals (Drosophila) of this model system, and, in addition, provide some thoughts on possible future directions for integrative approaches in this research area.},

We suggest that the Millennium Development Goals need to be reframed in such a planetary stewardship context combined with a call for a new social contract on global sustainability.

As an example, we apply this method to oviposition preference data for butterflies in the genus Lycaeides. Using this method, we estimate the parameters that describe preference for each population, compare the preference hierarchies among populations, and explore various models that group populations that share the same preference hierarchy.},

Fitness-associated loci exhibited both geographic and climatic signatures of local adaptation. Relative to genomic controls, high-fitness alleles were generally distributed closer to the site where they increased fitness, occupying specific and distinct climate spaces. Independent loci with different molecular functions contributed most strongly to fitness variation in each site. Independent local adaptation by distinct genetic mechanisms may facilitate a flexible evolutionary response to changing environment across a species range.},

  abstract = {How populations and species respond to modified environmental conditions is critical to their persistence both now and into the future, particularly given the increasing pace of environmental change. The process of adaptation to novel environmental conditions can occur via two mechanisms: (1) the expression of phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to express varying phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions), and (2) evolution via selection for particular phenotypes, resulting in the modification of genetic variation in the population. Plasticity, because it acts at the level of the individual, is often hailed as a rapid-response mechanism that will enable organisms to adapt and survive in our rapidly changing world. But plasticity can also retard adaptation by shifting the distribution of phenotypes in the population, shielding it from natural selection. In addition to which, not all plastic responses are adaptive\textemdash{}now well-documented in cases of ecological traps. In this theme issue, we aim to present a considered view of plasticity and the role it could play in facilitating or hindering adaption to environmental change. This introduction provides a re-examination of our current understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation and sets the theme issue's contributions in their broader context. Four key themes emerge: the need to measure plasticity across both space and time; the importance of the past in predicting the future; the importance of the link between plasticity and sexual selection; and the need to understand more about the nature of selection on plasticity itself. We conclude by advocating the need for cross-disciplinary collaborations to settle the question of whether plasticity will promote or retard species' rates of adaptation to ever-more stressful environmental conditions.This article is part of the theme issue `The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have used a variety of comparative mensurative and manipulative experimental approaches to study the biological consequences of habitat fragmentation. In this paper, we evaluate the merits of the two major approaches and offer guidelines for selecting a design. Manipulative experiments rigorously assess fragmentation effects by comparing pre- and post-treatment conditions. Yet they are often constrained by a number of practical limitations, such as the difficulty in implementing large-scale treatments and the impracticality of measuring the long-term (decades to centuries) responses to the im- posed treatments. Comparative mensurative studies generally involve substituting space for time, and without pre-treatment control, can be constrained by variability in ecological characteristics among different landscapes. These confounding effects can seriously limit the strength of inferences. Depending on the scale of the study system and how ``landscape'' is defined, both approaches may be limited by the difficulty of replicating at the landscape scale. Overall, both mensurative and manipulative approaches have merit and can contribute to the body of knowledge on fragmentation. However, from our review of 134 fragmentation studies published recently in three major ecological journals, it is evident that most ma- nipulative and mensurative fragmentation experiments have not provided clear insights into the ecological mechanisms and effects of habitat fragmentation. We discuss the reasons for this and conclude with recommendations for improving the design and implementation of fragmentation experiments.},

Inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk. Further, most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact. The contributions of mutation accumulation to extinction risk in threatened taxa appear to be small and to require very many generations. Thus, there is now sufficient evidence to regard the controversies regarding the contribution of genetic factors to extinction risk as resolved. If genetic factors are ignored, extinction risk will be underestimated and inappropriate recovery strategies may be used. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Droughts and other anticipated changes in precipitation may be particularly potent selective factors, especially in arid regions. Here we demonstrate the evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought. Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed and raised under a set of common environments with descendant (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestorxdescendant hybrids. As predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9 days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The intermediate flowering time of ancestorxdescendant hybrids supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few generations. A systematic effort to collect and store propagules from suitable species would provide biologists with materials to detect and elucidate the genetic basis of further evolutionary shifts driven by climate change.},

Summary

The rate of CO2 assimilation by plants is directly influenced by the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, ca. As an environmental variable, ca also has a unique global and historic significance. Although relatively stable and uniform in the short term, global ca has varied substantially on the timescale of thousands to millions of years, and currently is increasing at seemingly an unprecedented rate. This may exert profound impacts on both climate and plant function. Here we utilise extensive datasets and models to develop an integrated, multi-scale assessment of the impact of changing ca on plant carbon dioxide uptake and water use. We find that, overall, the sensitivity of plants to rising or falling ca is qualitatively similar across all scales considered. It is characterised by an adaptive feedback response that tends to maintain 1~-~ci/ca, the relative gradient for CO2 diffusion into the leaf, relatively constant. This is achieved through predictable adjustments to stomatal anatomy and chloroplast biochemistry. Importantly, the long-term response to changing ca can be described by simple equations rooted in the formulation of more commonly studied short-term responses.},

  abstract = {Timing is critically important in many things in life. Sometimes it is best to be first, and sometimes it is decidedly not. A trait that illustrates this idea particularly well is the timing of flowering in plants (Primack, 1985; Rathcke and Lacey, 1985). A plant that flowers too early or too late can miss out on reproduction entirely and be quickly weeded from the gene pool. But while many traits influence fitness, flowering time is perhaps unique in influencing a multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes, including mating patterns, gene flow, and interactions between plant and animal pollinators (Elzinga et al., 2007). In addition to influencing ecological and evolutionary processes, phenology is also acutely shaped by them, with flowering time clearly responding (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003) and, in some cases rapidly adapting (Franks et al., 2007), to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, the timing of flowering often has profound influences on connections between different levels of organization, with effects that ripple up the ecological hierarchy from individuals to populations, communities, and ecosystems. Flowering time can also directly interconnect ecological and evolutionary processes and play a key role in eco-evolutionary dynamics, which is the way that contemporary evolutionary changes influence ecological interactions (Pelletier et al., 2009). The profoundly important way in which flowering time influences these interconnections is an exciting, active area of research.},

  abstract = {By the end of this century, mean annual temperatures in the Northeastern United States are expected to warm by 3\textendash{}5 \textdegree{}C, which will have significant impacts on the structure and function of temperate forests in this region. To improve understanding of these impacts, we exploited two recent climate anomalies to explore how the springtime phenology of Northeastern temperate deciduous forests will respond to future climate warming. Specifically, springtime temperatures in 2010 and 2012 were the warmest on record in the Northeastern United States, with temperatures that were roughly equivalent to the lower end of warming scenarios that are projected for this region decades from now. Climate conditions in these two years therefore provide a unique empirical basis, that complements model-based studies, for improving understanding of how northeastern temperate forest phenology will change in the future. To perform our investigation, we analyzed near surface air temperatures from the United States Historical Climatology Network, time series of satellite-derived vegetation indices from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and in situ phenological observations. Our study region encompassed the northern third of the eastern temperate forest ecoregion, extending from Pennsylvania to Canada. Springtime temperatures in 2010 and 2012 were nearly 3 \textdegree{}C warmer than long-term average temperatures from 1971\textendash{}2000 over the region, leading to median anomalies of more than 100 growing degree days. In response, satellite and ground observations show that leaf emergence occurred up to two weeks earlier than normal, but with significant sensitivity to the specific timing of thermal forcing. These results are important for two reasons. First, they provide an empirical demonstration of the sensitivity of springtime phenology in northeastern temperate forests to future climate change that supports and complements modelbased predictions. Second, our results show that subtle differences in the character of thermal forcing can substantially alter the timing of leaf emergence and canopy development. By explicitly comparing and contrasting the timing of thermal forcing and leaf phenology in 2010 and 2012, we show that even though temperatures were warmer in 2012 than in 2010, the nature and timing of thermal forcing in 2010 lead to leaf emergence that was almost a week earlier than 2012.},

  abstract = {Background
The rich literature that characterizes the field of pollination biology has focused largely on animal-pollinated plants. At least 10 \% of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.

Scope and Conclusions
Wind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

The protocols tested included two levels of migration as well as inbreeding followed by selection, each with appropriate controls. Each low-founder-number population was founded with two pairs of flies. The maximum migration scheme had 50\% migration per generation, and the minimum migration populations experienced a migration rate of 2.5\% per generation. The control level of migration was 0\%. A fourth low-founder-number treatment was designed to test the effect of inbreeding followed by selection. Two sets of high-founder-number control groups were also derived from the stock population. Two fitness measures, viability and productivity of the populations, were recorded at the fifth generation. Populations in the minimum-migration and zero migration treatment groups had lower fitness than populations in any other treatment for both measures. Populations that experienced inbreeding and selection for high fitness levels, high levels of migration, or large high-founder-number populations were equally fit. These results demonstrate that a captive-breeding scheme that contains substantial levels of migration or inbreeding followed by selection can yield highly adapted populations.},

On average, growing-season length decreases by 30\% from shallow to deeper parts of the snowbed. Past work has shown that plant cover and soil fertility decline with delayed snowmelt date along this steep habitat gradient. We experimentally uncoupled the relationship between snowmelt schedule and site fertility by adding snow to plots at naturally shallow snow depths and removing snow prematurely from plots with naturally deeper snow in the summers of 1991\textendash{}1994. Seeds of R. adoneus were transplanted into manipulated plots and adjacent control plots in 1990 and 1991. Seedling shoot size and survival were monitored over the course of the experiment. Production of true (adult) leaves by newly emerging seedlings was significantly reduced by the delayed snowmelt schedule. Seedlings failing to produce true leaves during their first summer were at a strong survival disadvantage over the winter months. Leaf length for seedlings that produced true leaves was not affected by snowmelt or location on the snow depth gradient; nor did leaf length affect overwinter survival.},

Under climate change, those effects could signal potential vegetation shifts occurring over large geographical areas, with major impacts on ecosystem form and function. In this article, we studied the effect of a single drought episode, occurred which in summer 2005, on a Scots pine population in central Pyrenees (NE Spain). Our main objective was to study the environmental correlates of forest decline and vegetation change at the plot level. General and generalized linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy defoliation, mortality and recruitment, and plot characteristics. A drought-driven multifactor dieback was observed in the study forest. Defoliation and mortality were associated with the local level of drought stress estimated at each plot. In addition, stand structure, soil properties, and mistletoe infection were also associated with the observed pattern of defoliation, presumably acting as long-term predisposing factors. Recruitment of Scots pine was low in all plots. In contrast, we observed abundant recruitment of other tree species, mostly Quercus ilex and Q. humilis, particularly in plots where Scots pine showed high defoliation and mortality. These results suggest that an altitudinal upwards migration of Quercus species, mediated by the dieback of the currently dominant species, may take place in the studied slopes. Many rear-edge populations of Scots pine sheltered in the mountain environments of the Iberian Peninsula could be at risk under future climate scenarios.},

However, while the models themselves have been parameterized and verified with physical empirical data, the simulated patterns of connectivity have rarely been compared to field observations. We demonstrate a framework for testing biological-physical oceanographic models by using them to generate simulated spatial genetic patterns through a simple population genetic model, and then testing these predictions with empirical genetic data. Both agreement and mismatches between predicted and observed genetic patterns can provide insights into mechanisms influencing larval connectivity in the coastal ocean. We use a highresolution ROMS-CoSINE biological-physical model for Monterey Bay, California specifically modified to simulate dispersal of the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula. Predicted spatial genetic patterns generated from both seasonal and annual connectivity matrices did not match an observed genetic cline in this species at either a mitochondrial or nuclear gene. However, information from this mismatch generated hypotheses testable with our modelling framework that including natural selection, larval input from a southern direction and {$\fracslash$} or increased nearshore larval retention might provide a better fit between predicted and observed patterns. Indeed, moderate selection and a range of combined larval retention and southern input values dramatically improve the fit between simulated and observed spatial genetic patterns. Our results suggest that integrating population genetic models with coupled biological-physical oceanographic models can provide new insights and a new means of verifying model predictions.},

These include production of tree biomass, soil carbon storage, berry production and game production potential. For example, biomass production was approximately 50\% greater with five than with one tree species. In addition, we show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components. Importantly, no single tree species was able to promote all services, and some services were negatively correlated to each other. Management of production forests will therefore benefit from considering multiple tree species to sustain the full range of benefits that the society obtains from forests.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine is a disabling disorder associated with myofascial and trigger point disorders in the neck. Pharmacological management is the first line of treatment; however, rehabilitation procedures aimed at lessening symptoms of myofascial and trigger point disorders may add value in the management of headache symptoms. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of myofascial and trigger point treatment in chronic migraine patients receiving prophylactic treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA. To evaluate the treatment effects on headache frequency and intensity, analgesic consumption, cervical range of motion, trigger point pressure pain threshold, quality of life, and disability. DESIGN: Pilot, single-blind randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. SETTING: Neurorehabilitation Unit. POPULATION: Twenty-two outpatients with chronic migraine.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either cervicothoracic manipulative treatment (N.=12) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in the upper trapezius (N.=10). Treatment consisted of 4 sessions (30 min/session, 1 session/week for 4 weeks). A rater blinded to treatment allocation evaluated outcomes before treatment, during treatment, and 1 month after the end of treatment. Consistent with the pilot nature of the study, feasibility was considered the primary outcome and efficacy the secondary outcome.
RESULTS: All patients completed the study. No adverse events were reported. No significant between-group differences in pain intensity were observed during the study period. At post-treatment evaluation, the total consumption of analgesics (P=0.02) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (P=0.02) drugs was significantly lower in the manipulative treatment group than in the TENS group. These effects paralleled significant improvements in trigger point sensitivity and cervical active range of motion.
CONCLUSIONS: Manipulative techniques aimed at reducing peripheral nociceptive triggers might add value in the management of chronic migraine symptoms and lower acute medication use. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: An interdisciplinary approach comprising pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies can reduce analgesic consumption and myofascial dysfunction symptoms in chronic migraine patients.

In particular, the parasites are more likely to be adapted to their local host population than to allopatric hosts when the parasite migration rate is larger than the host migration rate. The opposite should be observed whenever hosts migrate more than parasites.},

  abstract = {We examined spatial genetic structure within eight populations of Sitka spruce classified as core or peripheral based on ecological niche, and continuous or disjunct based on species distribution. In each population, 200 trees were spatially mapped and genotyped for eight cDNA-based sequence tagged site (STS) codominant markers. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed by estimating p(ij), the average co-ancestry coefficient, between individuals within distance intervals. The distribution of alleles and genotypes within core populations was almost random, with nonsignificant co-ancestry values among trees as close as 50 m in core populations. In contrast, the distribution of alleles and genotypes within peripheral populations revealed an aggregation of similar multilocus genotypes, with co-ancestry values greater than 0.20 among trees up to 50 m apart and significant, positive values between trees up to 500 m. The relatively high density of reproductive adults in core populations may lead to highly overlapping seed shadows that limit development of spatial genetic structure. However, in peripheral populations with a lower density of adults, the distribution of alleles and genotypes was highly structured, likely due to offspring establishment near maternal trees and subsequent biparental inbreeding, as well as more recent population establishment at the leading edge of post-Pleistocene range expansion. Conserving genetic diversity in peripheral populations may require larger reserves for in situ conservation than required in core populations. These data on spatial genetic structure can be used to provide guidance for sampling strategies for both ex situ conservation and research collections.},

Large numbers of trees (N = 200) were sampled from each of eight populations to evaluate the distribution of rare as well as common alleles across the species range. Codominant alleles for eight sequence-tagged site loci were classified based on frequency and geographic distribution in order to develop appropriate sampling strategies to target specific classes of alleles. An important finding of this study is the similarity in genetic diversity as measured by expected heterozygosity between core populations (mean HE= 0.58) and peripheral populations (mean HE= 0.56). However, there was significant inbreeding in peripheral (FIS= 0.17) but not in core (FIS= 0.03) populations. Large differences in gene flow estimates were observed between core (Nm = 9.0) and peripheral populations (Nm = 3.5). Irrespective of population classification, over 75\% of the alleles were common and widespread. Only one allele was classified as rare and localized, and this allele was limited to one core, disjunct and two peripheral, disjunct populations. There was stronger evidence of past bottlenecks in peripheral, disjunct populations than in core, continuous populations. Results are used to suggest sampling strategies for capture of maximum level of genetic diversity and conservation of rare alleles. The conservation of peripheral, particularly disjunct, populations as well as populations in putative glacial refugia may present the best opportunity for conserving rare alleles. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Connectivity is a key concern in natural resource planning. Many studies have focused on the development of methods, tools and indices for the assessment of both components of connectivity: structural and functional. In particular, approaches based on graph theory principles have been recently proposed and are being increasingly applied to guide landscape connectivity conservation. However, forest planners and managers still need effective and operational methodologies to detect those landscapes where connectivity should be treated as a particularly critical conservation concern. In addition, in the Mediterranean, as in other parts of the world, socioeconomic changes in the last decades have driven the abandonment of many formerly cultivated lands. This poses both a challenge and an opportunity for managers intending to restore ecological connectivity in forested areas. In this context, setting adequate priorities for the reforestation of agricultural lands is of outmost importance. Here we show how a two-stage hierarchical methodology based on network analysis can be used to meet these needs. In particular, we apply a graph metric based on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale (the Integral Index of Connectivity) to two Mediterranean forest districts in Spain with different management objectives and environmental heterogeneity. First, we identify those landscapes where efforts to improve forest connectivity should be concentrated. In a second stage, we prioritize within those landscapes the individual patches of agricultural lands that, being available for a potential reforestation program, would contribute most to uphold connectivity and ecological flows at wide spatial scales. We show how the extent of the agricultural patches is not strictly related to the contribution to connectivity they would provide if reforested, and how the results of such analysis vary with species traits (dispersal capabilities). We discuss the suitability of the proposed approach for forest landscape planning purposes and conclude that it can provide a useful diagnosis and helpful guidelines for the development of efficient reforestation programs that might be applied in a variety of situations for improving the ecological coherence of forest landscapes. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Models are developed for the evolution of a quantitative trait under clinally varying selection in a species whose density decreases from the center of the range to its periphery. Two major results emerge. First, gene flow from populations at the range center can be a strong force that inhibits peripheral populations from evolving to their local ecological optima. As a result, peripheral populations experience persistent directional selection. Second, response to local selection pressures can cause rapid and substantial evolution when a peripheral population is isolated from gene flow. The amount of evolutionary change depends on gene flow, selection, the ecological gradient, and the trait's heritability. Rapid divergence can also occur between the two halves of a formerly continuous population that is divided by a vicariant event. A general conclusion is that disruption of gene flow can cause evolutionary divergence, perhaps leading to speciation, in the absence of contributions from random genetic drift.},

  abstract = {Aim To assess the effect of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity on the potential distribution of species under future climate changes. Trees may be adapted to specific climatic conditions; however, species range predictions have classically been assessed by species distribution models (SDMs) that do not account for intra-specific genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, because SDMs rely on the assumption that species respond homogeneously to climate change across their range, i.e. a species is equally adapted throughout its range, and all species are equally plastic. These assumptions could cause SDMs to exaggerate or underestimate species at risk under future climate change.Location The Iberian Peninsula.Methods Species distributions are predicted by integrating experimental data and modelling techniques. We incorporate plasticity and local adaptation into a SDM by calibrating models of tree survivorship with adaptive traits in provenance trials. Phenotypic plasticity was incorporated by calibrating our model with a climatic index that provides a measure of the differences between sites and provenances.Results We present a new modelling approach that is easy to implement and makes use of existing tree provenance trials to predict species distribution models under global warming. Our results indicate that the incorporation of intra-population genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in SDMs significantly altered their outcome. In comparing species range predictions, the decrease in area occupancy under global warming conditions is smaller when considering our survival\textendash{}adaptation model than that predicted by a `classical SDM' calibrated with presence\textendash{}absence data. These differences in survivorship are due to both local adaptation and plasticity. Differences due to the use of experimental data in the model calibration are also expressed in our results: we incorporate a null model that uses survival data from all provenances together. This model always predicts less reduction in area occupancy for both species than the SDM calibrated with presence\textendash{}absence.Main conclusions We reaffirm the importance of considering adaptive traits when predicting species distributions and avoiding the use of occurrence data as a predictive variable. In light of these recommendations, we advise that existing predictions of future species distributions and their component populations must be reconsidered.},

We review, explain and harmonize the main findings from this new generation of models that, by including trait variation over geographical scales, are able to provide new insights into future species ranges. Overall, {$\Delta$}TraitSDM predictions generally deliver a less alarming message than previous models of species distribution under new climates, indicating that phenotypic plasticity should help, to a considerable degree, some plant populations to persist under climate change. The development of {$\Delta$}TraitSDMs offers a new perspective to analyse intraspecific variation in single and multiple traits, with the rationale that trait (co)variation and consequently fitness can significantly change across geographical gradients and new climates.},

  abstract = {Many theoretical models predict when genetic evolution and phenotypic plasticity allow adaptation to changing environmental conditions. These models generally assume stabilizing selection around some optimal phenotype. We however often ignore how optimal phenotypes change with the environment, which limit our understanding of the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity. Here, we propose an approach based on our knowledge of the causal relationships between climate, adaptive traits, and fitness to further these questions. This approach relies on a sensitivity analysis of the process-based model Phenofit, which mathematically formalizes these causal relationships, to predict fitness landscapes and optimal budburst dates along elevation gradients in three major European tree species. Variation in the overall shape of the fitness landscape and resulting directional selection gradients were found to be mainly driven by temperature variation. The optimal budburst date was delayed with elevation, while the range of dates allowing high fitness narrowed and the maximal fitness at the optimum decreased. We also found that the plasticity of the budburst date should allow tracking the spatial variation in the optimal date, but with variable mismatch depending on the species, ranging from negligible mismatch in fir, moderate in beech, to large in oak. Phenotypic plasticity would therefore be more adaptive in fir and beech than in oak. In all species, we predicted stronger directional selection for earlier budburst date at higher elevation. The weak selection on budburst date in fir should result in the evolution of negligible genetic divergence, while beech and oak would evolve counter-gradient variation, where genetic and environmental effects are in opposite directions. Our study suggests that theoretical models should consider how whole fitness landscapes change with the environment. The approach introduced here has the potential to be developed for other traits and species to explore how populations will adapt to climate change.},

Here, we propose a new direct method based on paternity analyses (Mixed Effect Mating Model) to estimate individual migration (mi ) and selfing rates (si ) together with the pollen dispersal kernel. Using this method and the KINDIST approach, we investigated the variation of mating system parameters within and between three populations of Fagus sylvatica along an elevational gradient. Among the mother trees, si varied from 0\% to 48\%, mi varied from 12\% to 86\% and the effective number of pollen donors (Nepi ) varied from 2 to 364. The mating patterns differed along the gradient, the top population showing higher m and lower s, and a trend to higher Nep than the bottom populations. The phenological lag shaped long-distance pollen flow both within population (by increasing mi at mother-tree level) and between populations (by increasing m at high elevation). Rather than the mate density, the canopy density was detected as a major mating system determinant within population; it acted as a barrier to pollen flow, decreasing the proportion of long-distance pollen flow and increasing si . Overall, the effects of ecological factors on mating system were not the same within vs. between populations across the gradient, and these factors also differed from those traditionally found to shape variation at range-wide scale, highlighting the interest of multiscale approaches.},

In this study of two parapatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. x. ssp. parviflora, we compared the fitness of population transplants within their native region, in a non-native region within the native range, and in the non-native range to assess whether range expansion might be limited by a greater intensity of selection on colonists of a new range versus a new region within the range.

Both subspecies had significantly higher fitness in the native range (range adaptation), whereas regional adaptation was weak and was found only in the predominantly outcrossing ssp. xantiana but was absent in the inbreeding ssp. parvifilora. Because selection intensity on transplants was much stronger in the non-native range relative to non-native regions, there is a larger adaptive barrier to range versus regional expansion. Three of five sequential fitness components accounted for regional and range adaptation, but only one of them, survivorship from germination to flowering, contributed to both. Flower number contributed to regional adaptation in ssp. xantiana and fruit set (number of fruits per flower) to range adaptation. Differential survivorship of the two taxa or regional populations of ssp. xantiana in non-native environments was attributable, in part, to biotic interactions, including competition, herbivory, and pollination. For example, low fruit set in ssp. xantiana in the east was likely due to the absence of its principal specialist bee pollinators in ssp. parviflora's range.

We find that pinyon pine trees susceptible to chronic insect attack have 33\% fewer ectomycorrhizae than resistant trees, demonstrating that the herbivore-mycorrhizae-host plant interaction differs between resistant and susceptible trees. We removed insects from susceptible trees and find that the mycorrhizal levels of these trees increased to a level comparable to that of resistant trees. This demonstrates that herbivores negatively affect the mutualism between ectomycorrhizal fungi and susceptible trees, and that mycorrhizal levels can rebound after herbivore removal. The dynamics of these interactions on resistant and susceptible plants could be important for understanding plant-pest interactions in natural and managed systems.},

  abstract = {Herbivores and mycorrhizal fungi commonly occur together on host plants and thus are likely to interact in ways that could indirectly affect each others performance. In this chapter, we review the published studies on these interactions and their implications for plant, herbivore and fungal populations and communities. Six major patterns emerge from our review. First, in the majority of cases, aboveground herbivores reduce mycorrhizal colonization and alter mycorrhizal fungal community composition. Second, mycorrhizae also affect herbivores, but these effects are highly variable and range from positive to negative. Third, both of these interactions are conditional. For example, mycorrhizae are more likely to be affected by herbivores as the herbivory and/or the cumulative effects of environmental stress intensify. Under relatively benign conditions, herbivory may have no effect on mycorrhiza, but as plants are challenged, the impacts of herbivores on mycorrhizae can be great. Fourth, all mycorrhizae are not equal; the impacts of mycorrhizae on herbivores differ greatly between arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) and ecto-mycorrhizal (EM) fungi and among species. Because different mycorrhizal species vary in their mutualistic effects on plants, such variation in impacts on herbivores should also be expected. Fifth, different types of herbivores are affected differently by mycorrhizae. Generalist herbivores appear to be affected more than specialists, and leaf chewers are more likely to be negatively affected, while sap feeders and their allies are more likely to be positively affected. Sixth, few studies have examined mycorrhizal effects on herbivores and herbivore effects on mycorrhizae in the same system. However, if interactions between aboveground herbivores and mycorrhizal fungi are similar to those observed between above- and belowground herbivores, they are likely to be highly asymmetrical with aboveground herbivores having greater negative effects on mycorrhiza than vice versa.},

In a linear regression model without interactions, this average predictive comparison is simply a regression coefficient (with associated uncertainty). In a model with nonlinearity or interactions, however, the average predictive comparison in general depends on the values of the predictors. We consider various definitions based on averages over a population distribution of the predictors, and we compute standard errors based on uncertainty in model parameters. We illustrate with a study of criminal justice data for urban counties in the United States. The outcome of interest measures whether a convicted felon received a prison sentence rather than a jail or non-custodial sentence, with predictors available at both individual and county levels. We fit three models: (1) a hierarchical logistic regression with varying coefficients for the within-county intercepts as well as for each individual predictor; (2) a hierarchical model with varying intercepts only; and (3) a nonhierarchical model that ignores the multilevel nature of the data. The regression coefficients have different interpretations for the different models; in contrast, the models can be compared directly using predictive comparisons. Furthermore, predictive comparisons clarify the interplay between the individual and county predictors for the hierarchical models and also illustrate the relative size of varying county effects.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental aspect of epidemic development at multiple spatial scales, including those that extend beyond the borders of individual fields and to the landscape level. In this research, we used the powdery mildew of hop (caused by Podosphaera macularis) pathosystem to formulate a model of pathogen dispersal during spring (May to June) and early summer (June to July) at the intermediate scale between synoptic weather systems and microclimate (mesoscale) based on a census of commercial hop yards during 2014 to 2017 in a production region in western Oregon. This pathosystem is characterized by a low level of overwintering of the pathogen due to the absence of the ascigerious stage of the fungus and consequent annual cycles of localized survival via bud perennation and pathogen spread by windborne dispersal. An individual hop yard was considered a node in the model, whose disease status in a given month was expressed as a nonlinear function of disease incidence in the preceding month, susceptibility to two races of the fungus, and disease spread from other nodes as influenced by their disease incidence, area, distance away, and wind run and direction in the preceding month. Parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood over all four years, but allowed to vary for time transition periods from May to June and June to July. The model accounted for 34\% to 90\% of the observed variation in disease incidence at the field level, depending on the year and season. Network graphs and analyses suggest that dispersal was dominated by relatively localized dispersal events (less than 2 km) among the network of fields, being mostly restricted to the same or adjacent farms. When formed, predicted disease due to dispersal from other hop yards (edges) associated with longer distance dispersal were more frequent in the June-July time transition. Edges with a high probability of disease transmission were formed in instances where yards were in close proximity or where disease incidence was relatively high in large hop yards, as moderated by wind run. The modeling approach provides a flexible and generalizable framework for understanding and predicting pathogen dispersal at the regional level, as well as the implications of network connectivity on epidemic development.},

  abstract = {Preface Landscape ecology continues to grow as an exciting, dynamic ecological discipline. With its broadscale emphasis and multidisciplinary approach, landscape ecology lends itself both to basic research and to applications in land management, land-use planning, wildlife management, ecosystem management, and conservation biology. Landscape ecology makes a unique contribution to the scientific community in its attention to ecological dynamics across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and as a result it has become increasingly important for students in the natural sciences to gain a basic understanding of the subject. Colleges and universities across the United States are incorporating courses in landscape ecology into their curricula. However, nearly every book on landscape ecology is a book to be read, lacking a hands-on approach. This text is intended to fill that void by providing a comprehensive collection of landscape ecology laboratory exercises. These teaching exercises stress the fundamental concepts of landscape ecology, rather than highly specialized, technical methods. While students will gain experience using a variety of tools commonly used in landscape ecology, we stress the conceptual understanding necessary to use these techniques appropriately. This book attempts to convey the myriad approaches used by landscape ecologists (as well as a multitude of approaches to teaching) and include group discussion, thought problems, fieldwork, data analysis, spatial data collection, exposure to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), simulation modeling, analysis of landscape metrics, spatial statistics, and written exercises. This book is divided into seven sections, which complement the companion textbook, Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice: Pattern and Process, by M. G. Turner, R. H. Gardner, and R. V. O{\^a}texttrademarkNeill. However, this textbook is also a useful stand-alone volume that can be used for teaching and learning. We also hope practicing landscape ecologists will find this book to be a useful reference.},

  abstract = {The percentage of a watershed occupied by agricultural areas is widely used to predict nutrient loadings and in-stream water chemistry because water quality is often linked to non-point sources in a watershed. Measures of the spatial location of source areas have generally not been incorporated into such landscape indicators although empirical evidence and watershed loading models suggest that spatially explicit information is useful for predicting loadings. I created a heuristic grid-based surface-flow model to address the discrepancies between spatially explicit and non-spatial approaches to understanding watershed loading. The mean and variance in loading were compared among thousands of simulated watersheds with varying percentages of randomly located source and sinks. The variability in loading among replicate landscapes was greatest for those landscapes with \$65\% source areas. This variance peak suggests that considering the spatial arrangement of cover types is most important for watersheds with intermediate relative abundances of sources and sinks as the wide variety of different spatial configurations can lead to either very high or very low loading. Increasing the output from source pixels (relative to the amount absorbed by sink pixels) among different landscapes moved the peak in variance to landscapes with lower percentages of sources. A final scenario examined both broad- and fine-scale heterogeneity in source output to disentangle the relative contributions of spatial configuration, percentage of source covers, and heterogeneity of sources in governing variability in loading. In landscapes with high percentages of source pixels, fine-scale heterogeneity in source output was responsible for a greater portion of the total variability in loading among different watersheds than was spatial arrangement. These results provide several testable hypotheses for when spatial and non-spatial approaches might be most useful in relating land cover to water chemistry and suggest improvements for the spatial sensitivity analyses of eco-hydrologic watershed models.},

We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's `soft selection' model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

Exposure and photosynthetic responses to low temperatureand high sunlight were compared among current-year seedlings of the conifers Abies lasiocarpa and Picea engelmannii, and the snowbank perennials Caltha leptosepala and Erythronium grandiflorum, in the alpine treeline ecotone. The ratio of silhouette (sunlit) to total leaf area of whole plants was greatest in A. lasiocarpa (0.33), 25\% lower in P. engelmannii (0.25), and at least 36\% lower in the snowbank perennials than for A. lasiocarpa. This indicated less structuralavoidance of high sunlight in the conifer seedlings, particularly A. lasiocarpa. CO2 assimilation (Asat)in A. lasiocarpa was reduced 40\% due to frosts, high sunlight (22\%), and their combination (90\%). Asatwas much less affected by frosts and high sunlight in P. engelmannii and especially the perennials. Following frost and high sunlight exposure, diurnal reductions in maximum photosynthetic efficiency, indicated by the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio FvIFm,corresponded to species differences in Asa,.A substantially greater degree of slowly-reversible, or irreversible LTP (44\% reduction in predawn Fv/Fm)occurred in the microclimate above snow for A. lasiocarpa compared to the other species. It appears that a higher resistance to LTP in the perennials may contribute to their greater occurrence in microsites with lower temperatures and higher sunlight compared to the conifer seedlings.},

  abstract = {Summary 1.The abundant centre model predicts that species abundance will decline from the centre towards the periphery of the geographic range. Thus, we expect to find decreases from the centre towards the edge in variables related to population dynamics such as population density and reproductive output. However, evidence for this pattern is contradictory, suggesting that geographically peripheral sites may not be ecologically peripheral. Populations may thrive in pockets of suitable habitat at the edge of the range or may be locally adapted to peripheral conditions. 2.This study examines how the position of a site within geographic and climatic ranges of 13 species is related to the population dynamics at one common location, The Desert Laboratory at Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, AZ, USA. 3.We used data on survival, fecundity, germination fraction and population density from a 25-year long-term data set on winter annual plants to determine whether there was a relationship between distance to the centre of the range and population dynamics. Geographic distance was calculated by determining the distance from the Desert Laboratory to the centre of the observed range determined from locality records. Climatic distance was calculated using the niche modelling software, maxent, and subtracting the mean climatic profile for the species range from that of the Desert Laboratory. 4.There was no relationship between mean population metrics and distance metrics. We found significant relationships between some geographic distance metrics and variance in fecundity, survival and per-germinant fecundity, but not germination fraction or population density. We did not find a relationship with any metric of population dynamic variation and climatic distance. 5.Synthesis.Our results indicate that geographic distance from the centre of the range of 13 annual plant species more strongly predicts their population dynamics than climatic distance. This study reinforces the importance of examining vital rates and their variation in order to properly capture the effect of position within a range on population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Rapid climate change is likely to impose strong selection pressures on traits important for fitness, and therefore, microevolution in response to climate-mediated selection is potentially an important mechanism mitigating negative consequences of climate change. We reviewed the empirical evidence for recent microevolutionary responses to climate change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the following three perspectives emerging from the published data. First, although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes, similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare. Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary responses to climate change is far from satisfactory as the documented responses are often - if not typically - based on nongenetic data. We reinforce the view that it is as important to make the distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component) responses clear, as it is to understand the relative roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the difficulties and their potential ubiquity in detection of microevolution in response to natural selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic studies on microevolutionary responses to natural selection in the context of long-term studies of vertebrates. The available evidence points to the overall conclusion that many responses perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions could be environmentally induced plastic responses rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence, clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is conspicuously scarce.},

  abstract = {Whether introduced species invasions pose a major threat to biodiversity is hotly debated. Much of this debate is fueled by recent findings that competition from introduced organisms has driven remarkably few plant species to extinction. Instead, native plant species in invaded ecosystems are often found in refugia: patchy, marginal habitats unsuitable to their nonnative competitors. However, whether the colonization and extinction dynamics of these refugia allow long-term native persistence is uncertain. Of particular concern is the possibility that invasive plants may induce an extinction debt in the native flora, where persistence over the short term masks deterministic extinction trajectories. We examined how invader impacts on landscape structure influence native plant persistence by combining recently developed quantitative techniques for evaluating metapopulation persistence with field measurements of an invaded plant community. We found that European grass invasion of an edaphically heterogeneous California landscape has greatly decreased the likelihood of the persistence of native metapopulations. It does so via two main pathways: (i) decreasing the size of native refugia, which reduces seed production and increases local extinction, and (ii) eroding the dispersal permeability of the matrix between refugia, which reduces their connectivity. Even when native plant extinction is the deterministic outcome of invasion, the time to extinction can be on the order of hundreds of years. We conclude that the relatively short time since invasion in many parts of the world is insufficient to observe the full impact of plant invasions on native biodiversity.},

  abstract = {In wind-pollinated tree species, wind conditions during pollination are a primary determinant of mating. The oft patchy distribution of trees over spatially heterogeneous environments suggests a metapopulation approach to the study of wind effects on pollen contributions to seeds. A mathematical model of distance-dependent pollen dispersal among five populations on a transect yields distributions of pollen sources, and thus their potentially adaptive genetic characteristics, in the seeds of each population. For scenarios of symmetric and directional dispersal over variable mean dispersal distance, structural characteristics of the seeds are quantified by effective number of pollen sources within populations and compositional differentiation of pollen contributions among populations. These measures avoid the problems of the fixation index F-ST, which confounds diversity and difference. Effects of wind depend on location. The population with the highest effective number of pollen sources in its seeds need not be the most representative nor even central. Symmetric dispersal over long distances can be statistically indistinguishable from random dispersal, but directional dispersal is not. Consequences for adaptation and practical implications for forest management and seed harvesting are discussed.},

  abstract = {The 20th century was a pivotal period at high northern latitudes as it marked the onset of rapid climatic warming brought on by major anthropogenic changes in global atmospheric composition. In parallel, Arctic sea ice extent has been decreasing over the period of available satellite data records. Here, we document how these changes influenced vegetation productivity in adjacent eastern boreal North America. To do this, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, model simulations of net primary productivity (NPP) and tree-ring width measurements covering the last 300~years. Climatic and proxy-climatic data sets were used to explore the relationships between vegetation productivity and Arctic sea ice concentration and extent, and temperatures. Results indicate that an unusually large number of black spruce (Picea mariana) trees entered into a period of growth decline during the late-20th century (62\% of sampled trees; n~=~724 cross sections of age {$>$}70~years). This finding is coherent with evidence encoded in NDVI and simulated NPP data. Analyses of climatic and vegetation productivity relationships indicate that the influence of recent climatic changes in the studied forests has been via the enhanced moisture stress (i.e. greater water demands) and autotrophic respiration amplified by the declining sea ice concentration in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait. The recent decline strongly contrasts with other growth reduction events that occurred during the 19th century, which were associated with cooling and high sea ice severity. The recent decline of vegetation productivity is the first one to occur under circumstances related to excess heat in a 300-year period, and further culminates with an intensifying wildfire regime in the region. Our results concur with observations from other forest ecosystems about intensifying temperature-driven drought stress and tree mortality with ongoing climatic changes.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies conclude that water limitations and heat stress may hinder the capacity of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) trees, a dominant species of Canada's boreal forests, to grow and assimilate atmospheric carbon. However, there is currently no scientific consensus on the future of these forests over the next century in the context of widespread climate warming. The large spatial extent of black spruce forests across the Canadian boreal forest and associated variability in climate, demography, and site conditions pose challenges for projecting future climate change responses. Here we provide an evaluation of the impacts of climate warming and drying, as well as increasing [CO2 ], on the aboveground productivity of black spruce forests across Canada south of 60\textdegree{}N for the period 1971 to 2100. We use a new extensive network of tree-ring data obtained from Canada's National Forest Inventory, spatially explicit simulations of net primary productivity (NPP) and its drivers, and multivariate statistical modeling. We found that soil water availability is a significant driver of black spruce interannual variability in productivity across broad areas of the western to eastern Canadian boreal forest. Interannual variability in productivity was also found to be driven by autotrophic respiration in the warmest regions. In most regions, the impacts of soil water availability and respiration on interannual variability in productivity occurred during the phase of carbohydrate accumulation the year preceding tree-ring formation. Results from projections suggest an increase in the importance of soil water availability and respiration as limiting factors on NPP over the next century due to warming, but this response may vary to the extent that other factors such as carbon dioxide fertilization, and respiration acclimation to high temperature, contribute to dampening these limitations.},

In populations composed of plants with temporally separated sexual phases (i.e. dichogamous or heterodichogamous populations), pollen-mediated gene flow is assumed to reflect phenological overlap between complementary sexual phases. In this study, we conducted paternity analyses to test this hypothesis in the temporally dimorphic tree Acer opalus. We performed spatially explicit analyses based on categorical and fractional paternity assignment, and included tree size, pair-wise genetic relatedness and morph type as additional predictors. Because differences between morphs in flowering phenology may also influence pollination distances, we modelled separate pollen dispersal kernels for the two morphs. Extended phenological overlap between male and female phases (mainly associated with inter-morph crosses) resulted in higher siring success after accounting for the effects of genetic relatedness, morph type and tree size, while reduced phenological overlap (mainly associated with intra-morph crosses) resulted in longer pollination distances achieved. Siring success also increased in larger trees. Mating patterns could not be predicted by phenology alone. However, as heterogeneity in flowering phenology was the single morph-specific predictor of siring success, it is expected to be key in maintaining the temporal dimorphism in A. opalus, by promoting not only a prevalent pattern of inter-morph mating, but also long-distance pollination resulting from intra-morph mating events.},

In this article, we present a prospectus for transferring our basic understanding of evolutionary rescue to wild and other non-laboratory populations. Current experimental and theoretical results emphasize how the interplay between inheritance processes and absolute fitness in changed environments drive population dynamics and determine prospects of extinction. We discuss the challenge of inferring these elements of the evolutionary rescue process in field and natural settings. Addressing this challenge will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of population persistence that combines processes of evolutionary rescue with developmental and ecological mechanisms.},

Cost surface analysis (CSA) estimates the permeabil- ity (friction) across a landscape and can be applied to dispersal modelling. Increasingly used in a diversity of applications, several fundamental assumptions that might influence the outputs of CSA (cost surfaces and least-cost pathways) have yet to be systematically examined. Thus, we explore two issues: the presumed relationship between habitat preferences and dis- persal behaviour as well as the degree of landscape fragmentation through which an organism moves by modelling a total of 18 sensitivity and dispersal scenarios. We explored the effect of fragmentation by altering the friction values (generally assigned using expert opinion) associated with patch and linear features. We compared these sensitivity scenarios in two sites that differed in fragmentation. We also used eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis)as an example invading species and compared diffusion models and two contrasting cost surface dispersal scenarios. The diffusion model underestimated spread because squirrels did not move randomly through the landscape. Despite contrasting assumptions regarding dispersal behaviour, the two cost surfaces were strikingly similar while the least-cost paths differed. Furthermore, while the cost surfaces were insensitive to changes in friction values for linear features, they were sensitive to assumptions made for patch features. Our results suggest that movement in fragmented landscapes may be more sensitive to assumptions regarding friction values than contigu- ous landscapes. Thus, the reliability of CSA may depend not only on the range of friction values used for patches but also the degree of contiguity in the landscape.},

  abstract = {Investigating spatial patterns of loci under selection can give insight into how populations evolved in response to selective pressures and can provide monitoring tools for detecting the impact of environmental changes on populations. Drosophila is a particularly good model to study adaptation to environmental heterogeneity since it is a tropical species that originated in sub-Saharan Africa and has only recently colonized the rest of the world. There is strong evidence for the adaptive role of Transposable Elements (TEs) in the evolution of Drosophila, and TEs might play an important role specifically in adaptation to temperate climates. In this work, we analyzed the frequency of a set of putatively adaptive and putatively neutral TEs in populations with contrasting climates that were collected near the endpoints of two known latitudinal clines in Australia and North America. The contrasting results obtained for putatively adaptive and putatively neutral TEs and the consistency of the patterns between continents strongly suggest that putatively adaptive TEs are involved in adaptation to temperate climates. We integrated information on population behavior, possible environmental selective agents, and both molecular and functional information of the TEs and their nearby genes to infer the plausible phenotypic consequences of these insertions. We conclude that adaptation to temperate environments is widespread in Drosophila and that TEs play a significant role in this adaptation. It is remarkable that such a diverse set of TEs located next to a diverse set of genes are consistently adaptive to temperate climate-related factors. We argue that reverse population genomic analyses, as the one described in this work, are necessary to arrive at a comprehensive picture of adaptation.},

ER emphasizes a shift to a perspective on evolutionary dynamics that focuses on short time-scales, genetic variants of large effects and absolute rather than relative fitness. The contributions in this issue reflect the state of field; the articles address the latest conceptual developments, and report novel theoretical and experimental results. The examples in this issue demonstrate that this burgeoning area of research can inform problems of direct practical concern, such as the conservation of biodiversity, adaptation to climate change and the emergence of infectious disease. The continued development of research on ER will be necessary if we are to understand the extent to which anthropogenic global change will reduce the Earth's biodiversity.},

This phenomenon of interference arises from competition between mutations of different strengths as well as competition between mutations that arise on different fitness backgrounds. Previous work has explored each of these effects in isolation, but the way they combine to influence the dynamics of adaptation remains largely unknown. Here, we describe a theoretical model to treat both aspects of interference in large populations. We calculate the rate of adaptation and the distribution of fixed mutational effects accumulated by the population. We focus particular attention on the case when the effects of beneficial mutations are exponentially distributed, as well as on a more general class of exponential-like distributions. In both cases, we show that the rate of adaptation and the influence of genetic background on the fixation of new mutants is equivalent to an effective model with a single selection coefficient and rescaled mutation rate, and we explicitly calculate these effective parameters. We find that the effective selection coefficient exactly coincides with the most common fixed mutational effect. This equivalence leads to an intuitive picture of the relative importance of different types of interference effects, which can shift dramatically as a function of the population size, mutation rate, and the underlying distribution of fitness effects.},

Our approach is based on a Bayesian model of networks that allows nodes to participate in multiple communities, and a corresponding algorithm that naturally interleaves subsampling from the network and updating an estimate of its communities. We demonstrate how we can discover the hidden community structure of several real-world networks, including 3.7 million US patents, 575,000 physics articles from the arXiv preprint server, and 875,000 connected Web pages from the Internet. Furthermore, we demonstrate on large simulated networks that our algorithm accurately discovers the true community structure.

The atmospheric model surface heat and momentum budget are evaluated by comparing with climatological ship-based estimates. Similarly the ocean model simulation of poleward heat transports is compared with direct ship-based observations for a number of sections across the globe.

In particular, the ocean has a 1.25\textdegree{} \textasciiacute{} 1.25\textdegree{} degree horizontal resolution and leads to a considerably improved simulation of ocean heat transports compared to earlier versions with a coarser resolution ocean component. The model does not have any spin up procedure prior to coupling and the simulation has been run for over 400 years starting from observed initial conditions. The sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice simulation are shown to be stable and realistic. The trend in global mean SST is less than 0.009 \textdegree{}C per century. In part, the improved simulation is a consequence of a greater compatibility of the atmosphere and ocean model heat budgets. The atmospheric model surface heat and momentum budget are evaluated by comparing with climatological ship-based estimates. Similarly the ocean model simulation of poleward heat transports is compared with direct shipbased observations for a number of sections across the globe. Despite the limitations of the observed datasets, it is shown that the coupled model is able to reproduce many aspects of the observed heat budget.},

  abstract = {Models to predict budburst and other phenological events in plants are needed to forecast how climate change may impact ecosystems and for the development of mitigation strategies. Differences among genotypes are important to predicting phenological events in species that show strong clinal variation in adaptive traits. We present a model that in- corporates the effects of temperature and differences among genotypes to predict the timing of budburst of coast Douglas- fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). The main components of the model are (i) functions to calculate the accumulation of chilling units (CU) and forcing units (FU) during dormancy and (ii) a function defining the combina- tions of CU and FU needed for budburst (the possibility line). The possibility line was fit to data from 59 populations sub- jected to eight different winter environments. Differences among populations were incorporated into the possibility line using population coefficients that vary the FU required for budburst. Correlations among the population coefficients and variables describing local environments supported the hypothesis that genetic variation in budburst is largely an adaptation to summer drought. The new model can be used to test potential seed transfers as a strategy to mitigate some of the effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {Assisted migration of warm-adapted genotypes to currently cooler climates may reduce maladaptation from future climate change. Few assisted migration trials have considered limitations of the cooler climates and pathogens currently present at transplant sites. This is especially important to consider in riparian ecosystems that are priority targets for restoration in the western United States as they harbor diverse communities. In an effort to validate assisted migration as an effective strategy for mediating the negative impacts of climate change, we used a provenance trial with replicated genotypes from 19 populations of the foundation riparian tree species, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), transplanted to a cold site to test for genetic variation in growth, mortality, and resistance to shoot blight fungi (Venturia sp.). Populations from cool sites had up to 4 times faster growth, 3 times higher survival, and 8 times higher resistance to Venturia than populations from warm sites, providing evidence of local adaptation to both climate and pathogenic fungi. Budburst phenology and shoot blight were correlated with frost damage, subsequent shrub-form architecture, and mortality. While climate change models predict 6 {$\circ$} C increases, plants transferred distances of 6 {$\circ$} C at this time would not perform well; an intermediate transfer distance of less than 3 {$\circ$} C would avoid maladaptation to the current environment during assisted migration. Thus, multiple and intermediate transfer phases to supplement local genetic variation will likely be necessary for effective assisted migration to accommodate current environments and large changes in climate. Implications for Practice \textbullet{} To avoid maladaptation to both current climates and future climates, a multi-phase transfer should be considered for assisted migration. \textbullet{} A transfer distance of over 3 {$\circ$} C should be avoided for Populus fremontii because of risk of severe damage from cold and pathogens. \textbullet{} Buffering trees from cold temperatures during plant estab-lishment may reduce potential for frost damage. We rec-ommend planting in spring in order to provide plants a full growing season to increase distance between the canopy and the soil, as soil surface temperatures are often cooler than the atmosphere during winter. \textbullet{} Including multiple genotypes from both local and warmer populations during restoration will improve opportunities for plants to adapt and maintain productivity in current and future biotic and abiotic environments.},

Fontainea picrosperma is a subcanopy rainforest tree that is of commercial interest because it is the source of tigilanol tiglate, a natural product used for the treatment of solid tumors. We identify patterns of pollen-mediated gene flow within natural populations of F. picrosperma and estimate genetic parameters and genetic structure between adult and juvenile groups using microsatellite markers. Our results show pollination events occur over much shorter distances than reported for tropical canopy species. At least 63\% of seeds are sired by male trees located within 30\,m of the mother. On average, 27\% of the local male population contributed to successful reproduction of F. picrosperma with most fathers siring a single seed, however, the contributions to reproduction were uneven. Larger male trees with more flowers had greater reproductive success than those with less flowers (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). There were comparatively low levels of genetic variation across the species (HE\,=\,0.405 for adult trees and 0.379 for juveniles) and we found no loss of genetic diversity between adult and juvenile trees. Short distance pollen flow and low genetic diversity is theoretically a prelude to genetic impoverishment, however F. picrosperma has persisted through multiple significant climatic oscillations. Nevertheless, the remaining low genetic diversity is of concern for domestication programs which require maximal genetic diversity to facilitate efficient selective breeding and genetic improvement of this commercially significant species.},

Variation in lodgepole pine and interior spruce seedlings suggested a more plastic strategy, favoring competitive traits across a wide range of climate conditions.

  abstract = {The rare aquatic plant Luronium natans (L.) Rafin. is a representative of the Littorelletea, i.e. plant communities growing typically in unproductive habitats with oligo- to meso-trophic, slightly acid to circumneutral soft waters. Apart from morphological and physiological adaptations to these particular habitat conditions, Littorelletea communities are characterised by their narrow ecological amplitude. Despite the fact that L. natans is reported to be limited to habitats with low calcium content, it is abundant in two of the numerous potential yet calcareous habitats in the floodplains of the Upper Rhone, and its tributary, the Ain River (France). The present study examines whether the restriction to such a low number of habitats is linked to particular abiotic conditions therein. It also aims to identify the range of floodplain habitats that belong to the species' fundamental niche, i.e. those where, after arrival, it would be able to establish in the absence of interspecific competition. L. natans was therefore transplanted to sites along a gradient of sediment composition, and allowed to establish during a competition-free period. Extensive physico-chemical analyses were carried out on sediment, surface and interstitial water of the transplantation sites. The species' fundamental niche appeared very large, since establishment was successful in 3/4 of the transplantation sites. The magnitude of establishment success differed greatly, but only redox-potential was significantly correlated with establishment success. Abiotic parameters could not provide a general explanation of complete establishment failure either. The experiment demonstrated that the restriction of L. natans distribution in these floodplains is not caused by a lack of habitats with suitable water and sediment chemistry. \textcopyright{}2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Projected ecosystem leaf area (LAI) of the stands was 1.72 m2 m-2 and 1.85 m2 m-2, respectively. Production efftciency (dry matter production per unit leaf area) was 0.129 kg m-2 year-1 for the young, and 0.160 kg m-2 year-1 for the mature stand. Production efficiency of the study sites was below the 0.188 kg m-2 year-1 reported for xeric, pure juniper stands in the northern Great Basin.

A climatic gradient with summer precipitation decreasing between southeast Arizona and northwest Nevada occurs in the pinyon-juniper region. Great Basin pinyon-juniper ecosystems lie at the dry-summer end of this gradient while pinyon-juniper ecosystems of the Colorado Plateau lie at about the middle of this gradient. in spite of wetter summers, pinyon-juniper ecosystems of northern Arizona are less productive than those of the Great Basin.},

The observed clonal repeatability for time of emergence of first pink female strobili and for maximum pollen shed averaged 0.42 and 0.41 respectively over the 3 seasons, indicating sufficient genetic control to allow extrapolation from one site to another. Total period of pollen shed and the degree to which male and female flowering were asynchronous were more strongly influenced by environment. As female flowering commences first, early pollen producers will have the greatest chance of crossing with a wide range of other clones. Assessments of early- and late-flowering clones in one orchard suggest that phenological variation has only a marginal effect on mean seed yield per cone in the orchard. It is argued that in these orchards phenology is likely to cause less deviation from random mating than would variation in fecundity traits, and that the degree of dichogamy in individual clones is generally insufficient to prevent self-pollination.},

We transplanted seedlings beyond the northern border and photoperiodically manipulated reproductive timing, a trait important for adaptation to shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes within the range, to determine whether further evolution of this trait would result in a phenotype viable beyond the range. Earlier reproductive induction enabled plants to produce mature seeds beyond the range and to achieve a reproductive output similar to those grown within the range. Therefore, evolution of earlier reproduction in marginal populations would be necessary for northward range expansion. This study is the first to empirically show that evolution in an ecologically important trait would enable a species to survive and reproduce beyond its current range. These results suggest that relatively few traits may limit a species' range and that identifying evolutionary constraints on such traits could be important for predicting geographic distribution.},

The bacteriocins produced wide zones of inhibition ranging from 5.9{$\pm$}0.000 to 24.00{$\pm$}0.000 mm against the 4 yeast strains tested. There was a significant difference (at p{$<$}0.05) between the yeast organisms and the bacteriocins from the Bacillus spp. The study reveals the antifungal property of bacteriocins from Bacillus spp. and serves therefore as a base for further studies in its use in the control of diseases and extension of shelf-life of products prone to fungi contamination.},

It assumes that extinction and adaptation are negligible at ecological scales. Meanwhile, shifts associated with global change have been observed in metacommunity composition (species pools affected by extinctions and introductions) and in phenotypes. This suggests that predictions of future composition must move beyond re-sorting present-day species with fixed traits. We extend plant species-sorting concepts to consider biogeography and demography. We give an empirical context, highlighting the influences of biogeography, species-sorting and adaptation on community composition.},

We next present an overview of GLMs and GAMs, and discuss some of their related statistics used for predictor selection, model diagnostics, and evaluation. Included is a discussion of several new approaches applicable to GLMs and GAMs, such as ridge regression, an alternative to stepwise selection of predictors, and methods for the identification of interactions by a combined use of regression trees and several other approaches.

The system is now critically challenged because (1) BEC champions in government, academia, and the private sector are disappearing through retirement and layoffs; (2) BEC is based on outdated notions of climax ecosystems in equilibrium with climate; and (3) the contemporary relevance and intellectual richness of this approach to ecosystem science is not comprehended by a generation of scientists and resource managers grappling with accelerating rates of change in climate and other environmental drivers. This review addresses ways to ensure that BEC remains robust and useful in an uncertain future. The Author proposes that BEC embrace complex systems science. Through a dialectical analysis of alternative paradigms in ecology, it is argued that BEC's holistic, developmental view of terrestrial ecosystems is fundamentally compatible with complexity theory and provides the information content missing from contemporary ecosystem ecology. Two examples of nonlinear modelling (adaptive landscapes and agent-based) to illustrate how the classification system can adapt from a largely linear and equilibrium, to a nonlinear, nonequilibrium perspective of ecosystem dynamics. The BEC program itself must function as a complex adaptive system to survive government downsizing and guide ecosystem management during difficult times, and to challenge and enlighten a new generation of scientists and citizens.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator\textendash{} prey interaction [Abrams, P. \& Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63\% that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. \& Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr \& Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44, 1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change \textendash{} less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution.},

  abstract = {Local adaptation at range edges influences species' distributions and how they respond to environmental change. However, the factors that affect adaptation, including gene flow and local selection pressures, are likely to vary across different types of range edge. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to investigate local adaptation in populations of Plantago lanceolata and P.~major from central locations in their European range and from their latitudinal and elevation range edges (in northern Scandinavia and Swiss Alps, respectively). We also characterized patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation in populations using molecular markers. Range-centre plants of P.~major were adapted to conditions at the range centre, but performed similarly to range-edge plants when grown at the range edges. There was no evidence for local adaptation when comparing central and edge populations of P.~lanceolata. However, plants of both species from high elevation were locally adapted when compared with plants from high latitude, although the reverse was not true. This asymmetry was associated with greater genetic diversity and less genetic differentiation over the elevation gradient than over the latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that adaptation in some range-edge populations could increase their performance following climate change. However, responses are likely to differ along elevation and latitudinal gradients, with adaptation more likely at high-elevation. Furthermore, based upon these results, we suggest that gene flow is unlikely to constrain adaptation in range-edge populations of these species.},

Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and other restriction based genotyping methods have become widely applied in these applications in non-model organisms. However, sequencing errors, depth, and reproducibility between library preps could potentially hinder accurate genetic inferences. In this study, we tested different sets of parameters in data filtering, different reference populations and eight estimation methods to obtain a robust procedure for relatedness estimation in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). We used a seed orchard as our study system, where candidate parents are known and pedigree reconstruction can be compared with theoretical expectations. We found that relatedness estimates were lower than expected for all categories of kinship estimated if the proportion of shared SNPs was low. However, estimates reached expected values if loci showing an excess of heterozygotes were removed and genotyping error rates were considered. The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix) estimation, however, performed poorly in kinship estimation. The reduced relatedness estimates are likely due to false heterozygosity calls. We analyzed the mating structure in the seed orchard and identified a selfing rate of 3\% (including crosses between clone mates) and external pollen contamination of 33.6\%. Little genetic structure was observed in the sampled Scots pine natural populations, and the degree of inbreeding in the orchard seed crop is comparable to natural stands. We illustrate that under our optimized data processing procedure, relatedness, and genetic composition, including level of pollen contamination within a seed orchard crop, can be established consistently by different estimators.},

In situ reserves can be a very efficient method of protecting genetic diversity in tree species if they are sufficiently large to sustain adequate populations and spatially well distributed to protect populations adapted to a range of environmental conditions. We use a geographical information system (GIS) based approach to assess the level of in situ protection based on forest inventory data. Recently revised maps of seed planning units used for management of genetic resources for 11 major commercial conifer species reflect geographic variation as observed in genetic tests. On this basis we investigate how well populations are represented in protected areas. Due to a systematic expansion of protected areas in the 1990s, it appears that conifer genetic resources are now well represented in protected areas. In this study we identify the remaining gaps for in situ protection and discuss implications for genetic resource management. Further, we evaluate protected areas for their importance with respect to gene conservation, and determine whether ground truthing is necessary to confirm that populations in protected areas are sufficiently large. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To account for adaptive genetic variation of tree species we stratify populations by ecological zones that represent different macroclimates. In a detailed example for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), we show that under certain conditions this approach can pinpoint gaps at the level of genetically differentiated populations without actually using genetic data. In a comprehensive case study, evaluating the outcome of a major protected area expansion between 1991 and 2001 for British Columbia, we demonstrate how extensive results from a community-wide GIS analysis can be summarized and presented for decision-making.

Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change},

  abstract = {Aim A number of assumptions underpinning the use of species distribution models to predict biological responses to climate change are violated for temperate and boreal tree species that are widespread, long-lived and genetically adapted to local climate conditions. To address this situation, we propose a methodology to account for the potential effects of genetic structure, adaptive potential and limited migration capacity. Location British Columbia, Canada. Methods Similar to the widely used `no migration' and `unlimited migration' scenarios, we employ more refined biological response scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of genetic adaptation to local environments and the capacity of species to adapt and migrate. These scenarios are realized by two sets of geographic delineations that partition the species range into multiple populations and that subdivide the study area into smaller landscape units. Results In a case study for British Columbia, we demonstrate how the approach can be used to evaluate the adequacy of a reserve system of 906 protected areas to ensure long-term maintenance of forest genetic resources for 48 tree species. We find that between 35\% and 85\% of locally adapted populations in protected areas are maintained under a median climate change scenario until the end of the century. A sensitivity analysis shows that assumptions about migration and adaptation capacity of species have a major effect on the projected conservation status. Main conclusions We propose that the results of species distribution models have practical value for conservation planning if the focus is on maintenance rather than loss of suitable habitat. Accounting for genetic structure, adaptive potential and migration capacity through best-case and worst-case scenarios provide important information to effectively allocate limited resources available for conservation action.},

  abstract = {The velocity of climate change is an elegant analytical concept that can be used to evaluate the exposure of organisms to climate change. In essence, one divides the rate of climate change by the rate of spatial climate variability to obtain a speed at which species must migrate over the surface of the earth to maintain constant climate conditions. However, to apply the algorithm for conservation and management purposes, additional information is needed to improve realism at local scales. For example, destination information is needed to ensure that vectors describing speed and direction of required migration do not point toward a climatic cul-de-sac by pointing beyond mountain tops. Here, we present an analytical approach that conforms to standard velocity algorithms if climate equivalents are nearby. Otherwise, the algorithm extends the search for climate refugia, which can be expanded to search for multivariate climate matches. With source and destination information available, forward and backward velocities can be calculated allowing useful inferences about conservation of species (present-to-future velocities) and management of species populations (future-to-present velocities).},

  abstract = {Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is an invasive alien species in Europe producing pollen that causes severe allergic disease in susceptible individuals(1). Ragweed plants could further invade European land with climate and land-use changes(2,3). However, airborne pollen evolution depends not only on plant invasion, but also on pollen production, release and atmospheric dispersion changes. To predict the effect of climate and land-use changes on airborne pollen concentrations, we used two comprehensive modelling frameworks accounting for all these factors under high-end and moderate climate and land-use change scenarios. We estimate that by 2050 airborne ragweed pollen concentrations will be about 4 times higher than they are now, with a range of uncertainty from 2 to 12 largely depending on the seed dispersal rate assumptions. About a third of the airborne pollen increase is due to on-going seed dispersal, irrespective of climate change. The remaining two-thirds are related to climate and land-use changes that will extend ragweed habitat suitability in northern and eastern Europe and increase pollen production in established ragweed areas owing to increasing CO2. Therefore, climate change and ragweed seed dispersal in current and future suitable areas will increase airborne pollen concentrations, which may consequently heighten the incidence and prevalence of ragweed allergy.},

  abstract = {In this lecture we consider state-space models, which often appear in macro, as well as other areas of economics. Example 1. For example, suppose, GDP growth, y t is given by y t =\textmu{} t + t \textmu{} t =\textmu{} t + -1 {$\eta$} t {$\sigma$} 2 0 where \textmu{} t is the slow moving component of GDP growth and t is noise with (t , {$\eta$} t) {$\sim$} iid N 0, 0 {$\sigma$} 2 {$\eta$} . Assume that a researcher observe y t , but not the latent trend \textmu{} t . Example 2. Markov Switching y t ={$\beta$} 0 + {$\beta$} 1 S t + t S t {$\in\lbrace$}0, 1\vphantom\{\} P (S t = 1|S t-1 = 0) =1 - q P (S t = 1|S t-1 = 1) =p If y t is GDP growth, we might think of S t as representing whether or not we're in a boom. We observe y t , but not the latent state S t . What is common for the two examples above is that there are some observed variable y t whose behavior depends on unobserved state (\textmu{} t or S t), let's call it {$\alpha$} t . Some questions we might want to answer in these examples include: 1. Estimate parameters: e.g. in example 1 estimate {$\sigma$} and {$\sigma$} {$\eta$} 2. Extract unobserved state: e.g. in example 1 estimate \textmu{} t 3. Forecast future values of y t . In a state space model, we have an (potentially unobserved) state variable, {$\alpha$} t , and measurements, y t . Let Y t 1 be all measurable (\{y 1 , ..., y t 1 \}) variables up to time t - 1. The state space model is characterized by - - (1) State equation, describing the evolution of state: F ({$\alpha$} t |{$\alpha$} t-1 , Y t-1) (2) Measurement equation, describing how the measurable variables relate to state variables f (y t |{$\alpha$} t , Y t-1) Cite as: Anna Mikusheva, course materials for 14.384 Time Series Analysis, Fall 2007. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Downloaded on [DD Month YYYY]. Kalman Filtering 2 The two equations allow us to write the joint likelihood of observed variables (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y T). There could be some unknown parameter \texttheta{} which we will drop for simplicity later on. T T f (y 1 , ..., y T ; \texttheta{}) = f (y 1 ; \texttheta{}) f (y t |y t 1 , ..., y = - 1 ; \texttheta{}) f (y 1 ; \texttheta{}) t=2 t f (y t t-1 ; \texttheta{}) =2 |Y For the likelihood, we need to find f (y t |Y t 1). This can be done in three general steps and is called filtering: - 1. f (y t |Y t 1) = f (y t |{$\alpha$} - t , Y t-1)f ({$\alpha$} t |Y t-1)d{$\alpha$} t 2. Prediction equation f ({$\alpha$} t |Y t 1) = F ({$\alpha$} t |{$\alpha$} t 1 ,) - - Y t-1 f ({$\alpha$} t-1 |Y t-1)d{$\alpha$} t-1 3. Updating equation f (y , (Y |Y) = t |{$\alpha$} t t-1)f ({$\alpha$} t t f {$\alpha$} t t |Y -1) f (y t |Y t 1) - On a theoretical level, this process is clear and straightforward. We go from f ({$\alpha$} 1 |Y 0) to f (y 1 |Y 0) to f ({$\alpha$} 1 |Y 1) to f ({$\alpha$} 2 |Y 1) to finally get f (y 2 |y 1), the conditional likelihood. However, notice that the two first steps include integration, and in practice, it is usually difficult to compute these integrals. There are two cases where the integration is straightforward. With discrete distributions, the integrals are just sums. With normal distributions, sub-vector of normal vector is normal, and conditionals are normal as well, this simplify life a lot. The corresponding procedure for normals is called Kalman filter. For other situations, integration is very difficult, one approach is called particle filtering. Kalman Filtering Suppose we have a state model: {$\alpha$} t = T {$\alpha$} t-1 + R{$\eta$} t (1) and a measurement: y t = Z{$\alpha$} t + S{$\xi$} t (2) with {$\eta$} t {$\xi$} t {$\sim$} iid N 0, Q 0 .

  abstract = {Recent advances in the application of the polymerase chain reaction make it possible to score individuals at a large number of loci. The RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) method is one such technique that has attracted widespread interest. The analysis of population structure with RAPD data is hampered by the lack of complete genotypic information resulting from dominance, since this enhances the sampling variance associated with single loci as well as induces bias in parameter estimation. We present estimators for several population-genetic parameters (gene and genotype frequencies, within- and between-population heterozygosities, degree of inbreeding and population subdivision, and degree of individual relatedness) along with expressions for their sampling variances. Although completely unbiased estimators do not appear to be possible with RAPDs, several steps are suggested that will insure that the bias in parameter estimates is negligible. To achieve the same degree of statistical power, on the order of 2 to 10 times more individuals need to be sampled per locus when dominant markers are relied upon, as compared to codominant (RFLP, isozyme) markers. Moreover, to avoid bias in parameter estimation, the marker alleles for most of these loci should be in relatively low frequency. Due to the need for pruning loci with low-frequency null alleles, more loci also need to be sampled with RAPDs than with more conventional markers, and some problems of bias cannot be completely eliminated.},

We use genome-wide estimates of admixture and phenotypic traits for trees in a common garden to examine the extent and direction of gene flow across a Picea hybrid zone, testing assumptions of the bounded hybrid superiority and tension zone models of hybrid zone maintenance. Seeds were collected from the ecological transition zone spanning from maritime to continental climates across the Picea sitchensis\textendash{}P. glauca contact zone, and 721 trees were planted in a common garden experiment within the hybrid zone. Individuals were genotyped using a panel of 384 candidate-gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) putatively associated with adaptive traits in Picea, and phenotyped at age ten for height and autumn cold hardiness. Low interspecific heterozygosity in hybrids indi- cated that intrinsic reproductive barriers were too weak to prevent widespread recombi- nation, although introgression appeared asymmetric with P. sitchensis dominating the zone. Whereas marker-based hybrid index was strongly correlated with climate and geography, phenotypic traits exhibited weak or no significant clines. Our results indi- cated that exogenous selection appeared to play a strong role in the distribution and structure of this hybrid zone, indicative of an environmentally determined bounded hybrid superiority model of hybrid zone maintenance, although endogenous mecha- nisms could not be ruled out.

The response of species to changing environments is likely to be determined largely by population responses at range margins. In contrast to the expanding edge, the low-latitude limit (rear edge) of species ranges remains understudied, and the critical importance of rear edge populations as long-term stores of species' genetic diversity and foci of speciation has been little acknowledged. We review recent findings from the fossil record, phylogeography and ecology to illustrate that rear edge populations are often disproportionately important for the survival and evolution of biota. Their ecological features, dynamics and conservation requirements differ from those of populations in other parts of the range, and some commonly recommended conservation practices might therefore be of little use or even counterproductive for rear edge populations.},

  abstract = {Characteristics of tree species may uniquely situate them to withstand environmental changes. Paleoecological evidence indicates that the geographic ranges of tree species have expanded and contracted several times since the last glacial epoch in response to directional environmental changes. For most tree species, these range fluctuations have been accomplished without any apparent loss of genetic diversity. A possible explanation that distinguishes most trees from many herbaceous plants is that much of the genetic variation within tree species is found within rather than among their populations. Thus, the extinction of a relatively large proportion of a tree species' populations would result in relatively little overall loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, phylogeographic studies indicate that for some tree species, habitat heterogeneity (elevation, slope aspect, moisture, etc.) in glacial refugia may have preserved adaptive genetic variation that, when recombined and exposed to selection in newly colonized habitats, gave rise to the local adaptation currently seen. The maintenance of genetic diversity in the face of extensive habitat fragmentation is also a concern. Many forest trees, however, may be buffered from the adverse effects of habitat fragmentation. First, the longevity of individual trees may retard population extinction and allow individuals and populations to survive until habitat recovery occurs. Second, considerable evidence is available that both animal and wind-pollinated tree species in fragments experience levels of pollen flow that are sufficient to counteract the effects of genetic drift. The combination of individual longevity, high intra-population genetic diversity and the potential for high rates of pollen flow should make tree species especially resistant to extinction and the loss of genetic diversity during changing environmental conditions. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In a three-year free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, two species of 30-year-old alpine conifers (Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata) were studied to test this hypothesis in situ in the Swiss Central Alps (2180 m above sea level). CO2 enrichment was combined with foliage removal to test the effect of altered source\textendash{}sink relationships on tree growth and leaf level responses. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis and increased nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in the needles of both species. While the deciduous larch trees showed longer needles and a stimulation of shoot growth over all three seasons when grown in situ under elevated CO2, pine trees showed no such responses. Irrespective of CO2 concentration, defoliation in both species stimulated photosynthesis and increased stomatal conductance in remaining current-year needles in the treatment year and reduced leaf nitrogen concentration in the year following defoliation. Defoliated larch trees had fewer and shorter needles with reduced NSC concentrations in the year following defoliation and showed no stimulation in shoot elongation when exposed to elevated CO2. In contrast, defoliation of evergreen pine trees had no effect on needle NSC concentrations, but stimulated shoot elongation when defoliated trees were exposed to elevated CO2. After three years, our results suggest that deciduous larch is carbon limited at treeline, while evergreen pine is not. However, as indicated by the defoliation treatment, the carbon economy of these trees can clearly be modified by extreme events. The expected changes in growth of these treeline trees with improving carbon availability as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase will thus depend on both the interplay between biotic and abiotic processes, and the species or tree functional types involved.},

But this approach creates a weaker connection between the results and the larger goals of the research enterprise and is thus less preferable than the observed-value approach. That is, rather than seeking to understand the effect for the average case, the goal is to obtain an estimate of the average effect in the population. In addition to the theoretical argument in favor of the observed-value approach, we illustrate via an empirical example and Monte Carlo simulations that the two approaches can produce substantively different results.},

A holdout is a population that persists in a microclimate for a limited period of time under deteriorating climatic conditions. Stepping stones successively occupy microclimates in a way that facilitates species' range shifts. Microrefugia refer to populations that persist in microclimates through a period of unfavorable climate. Because climate projections show that return to present climate is highly unlikely, conservation strategies need to be built around holdouts and stepping stones, rather than low-probability microrefugia. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Seedlings from a central and a northern Finnish provenance of Pinus sylvestris, and from a central Finnish provenance of Picea abies, were raised in paper pots in a mixture of peat and sand, and grown outside. At the end of the second growing season, the seedlings were transferred to dark growth chambers and subjected to chilling conditions. In one experiment the chilling took place outside. The seedlings were then subjected to forcing temperatures (12-22 degrees C) in growth chambers. Bud burst was said to have occurred if the total growth of the terminal bud exceeded 5 mm. Behaviour of the Finnish material differed from that predicted by models based on studies of more southerly provenances. The new model is described, and further model development outlined.},

As more people will age with a history of cancer than ever before, it is important to consider how experiences of cancer affect the life course through the bending of time and its interpretation. As such, aging as a cancer survivor must be at the forefront of health maintenance across the life course. Design and Methods: Through reference to my own cancer experiences in an auto-ethnographic format, this article inter-prets the illness experience as co-occurring in a young, aging body. This enhances our understanding of biographical recon-struction and individual liminality through descriptions of wisdom imparted by the cancer experience itself. Knowledge and wisdom are further interpreted as enhancing researchers' understandings of cancer and cancer survivorship. Results: In this article, I use my illness experiences as a young person to describe evolving interpretations of the life course, the aging body, and the self. Implications: Concepts presented in this article aid researchers' understanding of how wisdom might be achieved through the experience of protracted illness over time. Such knowledge has important implications for the management of cancer as chronic, which may be most clearly described through the lens of the ill person.},

Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within approximate to 1 degrees C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than approximate to 1 degrees C, relative to 2000, will constitute "dangerous" climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species.},

Still, the mathematical theory of evolution is dominated by a gene-by-gene perspective in which genes are assumed to have the same effects regardless of genetic background. Gene interaction, or epistasis, plays a role in some theoretical developments such as the evolution of recombination, reproductive isolation, and canalization, but is strikingly missing from our standard accounts of phenotypic adaptation. This absence is most puzzling within the field of quantitative genetics, which, despite its polygenic perspective and elaborate statistical representation of epistasis, has not found a single important role for gene interaction in evolution. To the contrary, there is a widespread consensus that epistasis is evolutionary inert, and that all we need to know to predict evolutionary dynamics is the additive component of the genetic variance. This view may have roots in convenience, but also in theoretical results showing that the response to selection derived from epistatic variance components is not permanent and will decay when selection is relaxed. I show that these results are tied to a conceptual confusion, and are misleading as general statements about the significance of epistasis for the selection response and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Most temperate woody plants have a winter chilling requirement to prevent budburst during mid-winter periods of warm weather. The date of spring budburst is dependent on both chilling and forcing; modeling this date is an important part of predicting potential effects of global warming on trees. There is no clear evidence from the literature that the curves of chilling or forcing effectiveness differ by species so we combined our data and published information to develop new curves on the effectiveness of temperature for chilling and forcing. The new curves predict effectiveness over a wide range of temperatures and we suggest both functions may be operating at the same time. We present experimental data from 13 winter environments for 5 genotypes of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) and use them to test various assumptions of starting and stopping dates for accumulating chilling and forcing units and the relationship between budburst and the accumulation of chilling and forcing units. Chilling started too early to be effective in one treatment but the other 12 environments resulted in budburst from many combinations of chilling and forcing. Previous reports have suggested benefits or cancellations of effects from alternating day/night or periodic temperatures. Our simple models do not include these effects but nevertheless were effective in predicting relationships between chilling and forcing for treatments with a wide range of conditions. Overall, the date of budburst changed only slightly (+1 to -11 days) across a wide range of treatments in our colder test environment (Olympia, WA, USA) but was substantially later (+29 days) in the warmest treatment in our warmer environment (Corvallis, OR, USA). An analysis of historical climate data for both environments predicted a wide range in date to budburst could result from the same mean temperature due to the relative weightings of specific temperatures in the chilling and forcing functions. In the absence of improved understanding of the basic physiological mechanisms involved in dormancy induction and release, we suggest that simple, universal functions be considered for modeling the effectiveness of temperature for chilling and forcing. Future research should be designed to determine the exact shape of the curves; data are particularly lacking at the temperature extremes. We discuss the implications of our data and proposed functions for predicting effects of climate change. Both suggest that the trend toward earlier budburst will be reversed if winter temperatures rise substantially.},

  abstract = {Many temperate and boreal tree species have a chilling requirement, that is, they need to experience cold temperatures during fall and winter to burst bud normally in the spring. Results from trials with 11 Pacific Northwest tree species are consistent with the concept that plants can accumulate both chilling and forcing units simultaneously during the dormant season and they exhibit a tradeoff between amount of forcing and chilling. That is, the parallel model of chilling and forcing was effective in predicting budburst and well chilled plants require less forcing for bud burst than plants which have received less chilling. Genotypes differed in the shape of the possibility line which describes the quantitative tradeoff between chilling and forcing units. Plants which have an obligate chilling requirement (Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western larch, pines, and true firs) and received no or very low levels of chilling did not burst bud normally even with long photoperiods. Pacific madrone and western redcedar benefited from chilling in terms of requiring less forcing to promote bud burst but many plants burst bud normally without chilling. Equations predicting budburst were developed for each species in our trials for a portion of western North America under current climatic conditions and for 2080. Mean winter temperature was predicted to increase 3.2-5.5\textdegree{}C and this change resulted in earlier predicted budburst for Douglas-fir throughout much of our study area (up to 74 days earlier) but later budburst in some southern portions of its current range (up to 48 days later) as insufficient chilling is predicted to occur. Other species all had earlier predicted dates of budburst by 2080 than currently. Recent warming trends have resulted in earlier budburst for some woody plant species; however, the substantial winter warming predicted by some climate models will reduce future chilling in some locations such that budburst will not consistently occur earlier.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we explore some of the complexity of adaptation genetics and discuss the strengths and limitations of genomics as a tool for characterizing evolutionary potential in the context of conservation management. Many traits are polygenic and can be strongly influenced by minor differences in regulatory networks and by epigenetic variation not visible in DNA sequence. Much of this critical complexity is difficult to detect using methods commonly used to identify adaptive variation, and this needs appropriate consideration when planning genomic screens, and when basing management decisions on genomic data. When the genomic basis of adaptation and future threats are well understood, it may be appropriate to focus management on particular adaptive traits. For more typical conservations scenarios, we argue that screening genome-wide variation should be a sensible approach that may provide a generalized measure of evolutionary potential that accounts for the contributions of small-effect loci and cryptic variation and is robust to uncertainty about future change and required adaptive response(s). The best conservation outcomes should be achieved when genomic estimates of evolutionary potential are used within an adaptive management framework.},

Location\hspace{0.6em} USA/Canada, Mexico, Europe/NW Africa, Transbaikal Siberia, Chile, South Africa and Australia.  Methods\hspace{0.6em} Digitized range maps for butterfly species in each region were used to map richness patterns in summer (for all areas) and winter (for USA/Canada, Europe/NW Africa and Australia). A phylogeny resolved to subfamily was used to map the geographic MRD patterns. Regression trees and general linear models examined climatic and vegetation correlates of species richness and MRD within and among regions.  Results\hspace{0.6em} Various combinations of climate and vegetation were strong predictors of species richness gradients within regions, but unresolved `regional' factors contributed to the multiregional pattern. Regionally based differences in phylogenetic structure also exist, but MRD is negatively correlated with temperature both within and across areas. MRD patterns consistent with tropical niche conservatism occur in most areas. With a possible partial exception of Mexico, faunas in cold climates and in mountains are more derived than faunas in lowlands and tropical/subtropical climates. In USA/Canada, Europe and Australia, winter faunas are more derived than summer faunas.  Main conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The phylogenetic pattern previously found in the USA and Canada is widespread in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and niche conservatism and the evolution of cold tolerance is the likely explanation for the development of the global butterfly species richness gradient over evolutionary time. Contemporary climate also influences species richness patterns but is unlikely to be a complete explanation globally. The importance of climate is also manifested in the seasonal loss of more basal butterfly elements outside the tropics in winter.

The restructuring qua remapping of resource peripheries is collectively shaped by institutional forces unleashed by post- Fordism and globalization that are fundamentally different from the restructuring of cores. As industrial regions, resource peripheries must negotiate the imperatives of flexibility and neoliberalism from vulnerable, dependent positions on geographic margins. For many resource peripheries, neoliberalism has been perversely associated with trade protectionism. As resource regions, the restructuring of resource peripheries has been further complicated by resource-cycle dynamics and radically new social attitudes toward the exploitation of resources that have helped spawn the politics of environmentalism and aboriginalism.Trade, environmental, and aboriginal politics have clashed around the world to contest vested industrial interests and remap resource peripheries in terms of their value systems. British Columbia's forest economy illustrates this contested remapping. For two decades, the powerful forces of neoliberalism, environmentalism, and aboriginalism have institutionalized a ``war in the woods'' of British Columbia that is sustained by shared criticism of provincial policy and disagreement over how remapping should proceed. The authority of the provincial government, which controls British Columbia's forests, has been undermined, but it remains vital to socially acceptable remapping. Meanwhile, the enduring war in the woods testifies that geography matters on the periphery.},

  abstract = {The study of positive species interactions is a rapidly evolving field in ecology. Despite decades of research, controversy has emerged as to whether positive and negative interactions predictably shift with increasing environmental stress as hypothesised by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH). Here, we provide a synthesis of 727 tests of the SGH in plant communities across the globe to examine its generality across a variety of ecological factors. Our results show that plant interactions change with stress through an outright shift to facilitation (survival) or a reduction in competition (growth and reproduction). In a limited number of cases, plant interactions do not respond to stress, but they never shift towards competition with stress. These findings are consistent across stress types, plant growth forms, life histories, origins (invasive vs. native), climates, ecosystems and methodologies, though the magnitude of the shifts towards facilitation with stress is dependent on these factors. We suggest that future studies should employ standardised definitions and protocols to test the SGH, take a multi-factorial approach that considers variables such as plant traits in addition to stress, and apply the SGH to better understand how species and communities will respond to environmental change.},

In the first case, horizontally homogeneous meteorologywas assumed. In this case, pollen concentration rapidly decreased with the distance from the source. In the second case, where the fully three- dimensional model was applied, atmospheric lifetime of the pollen grains increased remarkably. This was mainly caused by the vertical wind speeds induced by topographic effects. Consequently, the pollen grains could travel much larger distances until they were deposited and finally removed from the atmosphere. This is an important finding with respect to the problem of cross pollination. Due to the lack of measurements, a number of parameters had to be assumed. However, the parameterisation proposed may well serve as a starting point of a daily pollen forecast with numerical models. 1.},

Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45\%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population's relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.},

Recently available gridded drought reconstructions have been developed for most of North America from a network of drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies, many of which span the last 1000 yr. These reconstructions enable the authors to Put the famous droughts of the instrumental record (i.e., the 1930s Dust Bowl and the 1950s Southwest droughts) into the context of 1000 yr of natural drought variability oil the continent. We can now, with this remarkable new record, examine the severity, persistence, spatial signatures, and frequencies of drought variability over the past milllenmum. and how these have changed with time.The gridded drought reconstructions reveal the existence of successive \&quot;megadroughts.\&quot; unprecedented in persistence (20-40 yr). yet similar in year-to-year severity and spatial distribution to the major droughts experienced in today\&apos;s North America. These megadroughts occurred during a 400-yr-long period in the early to middle second millennium A.D., with a climate varying as today\&apos;s, but around a drier mean. The implication is that the mechanism forcing persistent drought in the West and the Plains in the instrumental era is analagous to that underlying the megadroughts of the medieval period. The leading spatial mode of drought variability in the recontructions resembles the North American ENSO pattern: widespread drought across the United States. centered On file Southwest, with a hint of the opposite phase in the Pacific Northwest.Recently, climate models forced by the observed history of tropical Pacific SSTs have been able to successfully simulate all of the major North American droughts of the last 150 yr. In each case, cool \&quot;La Nina-like\&quot; conditions in the tropical Pacific arc consistent with North American drought. With ENSO showing a Pronounced signal in the gridded drought recontructions of the last millennium. both in terms of its link to the leading spatial mode, and the leading time scales of drought variability (revealed by multitaper spectral analysis and wavelet analysis), it is postulated that, as for the modern clay, the medieval megadroughts were forced by protracted La Nina-like tropical Pacific SSTs. Further evidence for this comes from the global hydroclimatic \&quot;footprint\&quot; of the medieval era revealed by existing paleoclimatic archives from the tropical Pacific and ENSO-sensitive tropical and extratropical land regions. In general, this global pattern matches that observed for modern-day persistent North American drought, whereby a La Nina-like tropical Pacific is accompanied by hemispheric, and in the midlatitudes, zonal, symmetry of hydroclimatic anomalies.},

A global application of the model suggests that the response found in the experiments might also be representative of the average response of forests globally.

However, the potential for evolutionary changes in dispersal ability to occur within these fragmented populations has received little attention. We examined morphological traits associated with flight and reproduction in fragmented populations of the silver-spotted skipper butterfly, Hesperia comma. Investment in flight was measured as relative wing area and thorax mass, and investment in reproduction as relative abdomen mass. All measurements were made on individuals reared in a common environment. In the UK, Hesperia comma was once fairly widely distributed in southern and eastern England, but retracted to its smallest UK distribution in the 1970s and 1980s. It then partially re-expanded in the North and South Downs in S.E. England. We first compared traits from colonised and refuge sites 2.9-4.5 km apart, and found no differences in relative investment in flight or reproduction. There were, however, significant differences in both relative thorax and abdomen mass between regions {$>$} 40 km apart. Populations with the highest relative investment in the thorax occurred in a region where population expansion has been most rapid. These results, in combination with other studies linking butterfly morphology to patch area and/or isolation, suggest that evolutionary responses to habitat fragmentation could be widespread.},

Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation.

Here we use the age and composition of volcanic rocks to reconstruct the geodynamic evolution of the westernmost Mediterranean from the Middle Miocene epoch to the Pleistocene epoch (about 12.1-0.65 Myr ago). Our data show that a marked shift in the geochemistry of mantle-derived volcanic rocks, reflecting a change from subduction-related to intraplate-type volcanism, occurred between 6.3 and 4.8 Myr ago, largely synchronous with the Messinian salinity crisis. Using a thermomechanical model, we show that westward roll back of subducted Tethys oceanic lithosphere and associated asthenospheric upwelling provides a plausible mechanism for producing the shift in magma chemistry and the necessary uplift (approximately 1 km) along the African and Iberian continental margins to close the Miocene marine gateways, thereby causing the Messinian salinity crisis.},

  abstract = {In their inaugural paper, Manel et al. (2003) defined landscape genetics as a combination of landscape ecology and population genetics. In more detail, these authors stated that landscape genetics `aims at providing information about the interaction between landscape features and microevolutionary processes, such as gene flow, genetic drift and selection' (Manel et al. 2003, p. 189). The first lesson to learn from this is that we are dealing with microevolution, i.e., evolutionary processes within species. Second, we are talking about gene flow and selection, two ecological and evolutionary processes that need different genetic approaches to be investigated Holderegger et al. 2006). Third, Manel et al. (2003, p. 190) remarked that `the two key steps of landscape genetics are the detection of genetic discontinuities and the correlation of these discontinuities with landscape environmental features, such as barriers', which provides relevant information for various scientific disciplines such as evolution, ecology or conservation biology. Hence, we need two data sets, a genetic one and a landscape ecological one, and we look for breaks, gradients or transitions that coincide in these two data sets. Manel et al. (2003) were less explicit in their landscape definition, and landscape ecologists are well aware that this is a difficult task (Turner et al. 2001). Thus, the definition of landscape genetics by Manel et al. (2003) was much clearer on the population genetic than on the landscape ecological side, including spatial scale. A pragmatic circumscription of landscape genetics could be that landscape genetics endorses those studies that combine population genetic data, adaptive or neutral, with data on landscape composition and configuration, including matrix quality. A comparison with metapopulation biology and metapopulation genetics may clarify the major characteristic of landscape genetics. Classical metapopulation studies are spatially implicit, they view the natural world as divided into cheerful islands (patches) and hostile sea (matrix) (Baquette 2004). Spatially realistic metapopulation models typically consider the geographic distance between patches (Ovaskainen and Hanski 2004), but do not include matrix quality. In landscape genetics, however, the landscape with its composition, spatial configuration and dynamics makes up half of the story beside genetics. Landscape genetics therefore is much closer to the real world than the classical metapopulation concept. For instance, the actual connectivity of populations in terms of dispersal of organisms may deviate markedly from an abstract population genetic gene flow index (Whitlock and McCauley 1999) or from a landscape ecological connectivity index calculated from a habitat map (Li and Wu 2004). Landscape genetics provides powerful tools for quantifying such processes in real landscapes. While population geneticists have eagerly adopted this approach, landscape ecologists have only started using genetic methods. Landscape genetics is an important emerging research topic that integrates landscape pattern with population genetics. It is a new way of sci- Landscape Ecology (2006) 21:793\textendash{}796 Springer 2006 DOI 10.1007/s10980-005-6058-6 entific thinking, whereas there exists neither a specific landscape genetic theory nor specific concepts. While landscape ecology partly shares these limitations (Wu and Hobbs 2002), the situation is different with population genetics, which has a well-founded theoretical basis (Hartl and Clark 1997). However, no landscape genetic research agenda has been defined to date, and landscape genetic data are still scarce. We believe that the benefit of landscape genetics lies in its heuristic, as well as practical, values of forcing landscape ecologists to think more about processes rather than spatial patterns, and to remind population geneticists that processes are affected by the quality of a landscape and not just by pure spatial distance (Holderegger et al. in press). This is new, especially when it comes to scientific practice.},

In the context of habitat fragmentation, the current focus of landscape genetics is on assessing the degree to which landscapes facilitate the movement of organisms (landscape connectivity) by relating gene-flow patterns to landscape structure. Neutral genetic variation among individuals or direct estimates of current gene flow are statistically related to landscape characteristics such as the presence of hypothesized barriers or the least-cost distance for an organism to move from one habitat patch to another, given the nature of the intervening matrix or habitat types. In the context of global change, a major challenge for landscape genetics is to address the spread of adaptive variation across landscapes. Genome scans combined with genetic sample collection along environmental gradients or in different habitat types attempt to identify molecular markers that are statistically related to specific environmental conditions, indicating adaptive genetic variation. The landscape genetics of adaptive variation may also help answer fundamental questions about the collective evolution of populations.},

  abstract = {Cold acclimation in conifers is a complex process, the timing and extent of which reflects local adaptation and varies widely along latitudinal gradients for many temperate and boreal tree species. Despite their ecological and economic importance, little is known about the global changes in gene expression that accompany autumn cold acclimation in conifers. Using three populations of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) spanning the species range, and a Picea cDNA microarray with 21,840 unique elements, within- and among-population gene expression was monitored during the autumn. Microarray data were validated for selected genes using real-time PCR. Similar numbers of genes were significantly twofold upregulated (1257) and downregulated (967) between late summer and early winter. Among those upregulated were dehydrins, pathogenesis-related/antifreeze genes, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes, and genes involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Among-population microarray hybridizations at early and late autumn time points revealed substantial variation in the autumn transcriptome, some of which may reflect local adaptation. These results demonstrate the complexity of cold acclimation in conifers, highlight similarities and differences to cold tolerance in annual plants, and provide a solid foundation for functional and genetic studies of this important adaptive process.},

  abstract = {Deviations of the site frequency spectrum of mutations (SFS) from neutral expectations may be caused by natural selection or by demographic processes such as population subdivision or temporal changes in population size. As most widespread temperate and boreal tree species have expanded from glacial refugia in the past 13,000 years, colonization bottlenecks associated with this migration may have left variable demographic signatures among geographic populations corresponding to distance from the refugia. To determine whether the signature of postglacial re-colonization has skewed the SFS in the widely distributed conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.), we re-sequenced 153 nuclear genes in six populations from across the species range. We found that while the SFS for the pooled sample produced negative values for Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H, these statistics exhibited strong clinal variation when populations were analysed separately (R(2) = 0.84, P = 0.007 for Tajima's D and R(2) = 0.65, P = 0.033 for Fay and Wu's H). When historical bottlenecks of varying age were simulated using approximate Bayesian computation, distance of populations from the southern range limit explained most of the variation in bottleneck timing among populations (R(2) = 0.89, P = 0.003). These data suggest that sequential population bottlenecks during postglacial re-colonization have resulted in diverse among-population signatures within the contemporary SFS in Sitka spruce, with rare variants more common in the south, and medium-frequency variants more common in the north. Our results also emphasize the need to consider sampling strategy and to explore population-specific null demographic models in surveys of nucleotide variation in widely distributed species.},

  abstract = {Gene flow and effective population size (N(e)) should depend on a population's position within its range: those near the edges are expected to have smaller N(e) and lower relative emigration rates, whereas those nearer the centre should have larger N(e) and higher relative emigration rates. In species with continuous ranges, this phenomenon may limit the ability of peripheral populations to respond to divergent selection. Here, we employ Sitka spruce as a model to test these predictions. We previously genotyped 339 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 410 individuals from 13 populations, and used these data to identify putative targets of divergent selection, as well as to explore the extent to which central-peripheral structure may impede adaptation. Fourteen SNPs had outlier F(ST) estimates suggestive of divergent selection, of which nine were previously associated with phenotypic variation in adaptive traits (timing of autumn budset and cold hardiness). Using coalescent simulations, we show that populations from near the centre of the range have higher effective populations sizes than those from the edges, and that central populations contribute more migrants to marginal populations than the reverse. Our results suggest that while divergent selection appears to have shaped allele frequencies among populations, asymmetrical movement of alleles from the centre to the edges of the species range may affect the adaptive capacity of peripheral populations. In southern peripheral populations, the movement of cold-adapted alleles from the north represents a significant impediment to adaptation under climate change, while in the north, movement of warm-adapted alleles from the south may enhance adaptation.},

  abstract = {Climate is the primary driver of the distribution of tree species worldwide, and the potential for adaptive evolution will be an important factor determining the response of forests to anthropogenic climate change. Although association mapping has the potential to improve our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of climatically relevant traits, the utility of adaptive polymorphisms uncovered by such studies would be greatly enhanced by the development of integrated models that account for the phenotypic effects of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their interactions simultaneously. We previously reported the results of association mapping in the widespread conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). In the current study we used the recursive partitioning algorithm 'Random Forest' to identify optimized combinations of SNPs to predict adaptive phenotypes. After adjusting for population structure, we were able to explain 37\% and 30\% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, in two locally adaptive traits-autumn budset timing and cold hardiness. For each trait, the leading five SNPs captured much of the phenotypic variation. To determine the role of epistasis in shaping these phenotypes, we also used a novel approach to quantify the strength and direction of pairwise interactions between SNPs and found such interactions to be common. Our results demonstrate the power of Random Forest to identify subsets of markers that are most important to climatic adaptation, and suggest that interactions among these loci may be widespread.},

What determines these limits through evolutionary time is an important issue that is receiving increased attention (Hoffman and Blows 1994).

Stasis in species' borders provides a particularly compelling category of "niche conservatism" -the observation that phylogenetic lineages often seem to retain much the same ecological niche over substantial spans of evolutionary history (Holt and Gaines 1992; Ricklefs and Latham 1992; Holt 1996). There are three basic classes of explanations for niche conservatism, particularly at species bor- ders: an absence of appropriate genetic variation (Bradshaw 1991; Bradshaw and McNeilly 1991); conservative selection, either within populations (Holt and Gaines 1992; Holt 1996) or among populations (Gomulkiewicz and Holt 1995), preventing evolutionary change in the niche; and gene flow swamping local selec- tion (Mayr 1963)},

Historically the phenomenon has been approached using a purely deterministic mathematical framework (usually involving differential equations of some form). These methods, while scientifically meaningful, are generally highly simplified and fail to account for uncertainty in the data and process, of which our knowledge could not possibly exist without error. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for population spread that accommodates data sources with errors, dependence structures between population dynamics parameters, and takes into account prior scientific understanding via non-linear relationships between model parameters and space-time response variables. We model the process (i.e., the bird population in this case) as a Poisson response with spatially varying diffusion coefficients as well as a logistic population growth term using a common reaction-diffusion equation that realistically mimics the ecological process. We focus the application on the ongoing invasion of the Eurasian Collared-Dove},

A classic example of reproductive character displacement, presumed to be caused by reinforcing selection, is flower-color variation in the native Texas wildflowerPhlox drummondii. Here, we use population genetic analyses to investigate molecular signatures of selection on flower-color variation in this species. First, we quantify patterns of neutral genetic variation across the range ofP. drummondiito demonstrate that restricted gene flow and genetic drift cannot explain the pattern of flower-color divergence in this species. There is evidence of extensive gene flow across populations with different flower colors, suggesting selection caused flower-color divergence. Second, analysis of sequence variation in the genes underlying this divergence reveals a signature of a selective sweep in one of the two genes, further indicating selection is responsible for divergence in sympatry. The lack of a signature of selection at the second locus does not necessarily indicate a lack of selection on this locus but instead brings attention to the uncertainty in depending on molecular signatures to identify selection. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Author(s).

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Recent studies have revitalized interest in methods for detecting evolutionary modes in both fossil sequences and phytogenies. Most of these studies examine single size or shape traits, often implicitly assuming that single phenotypic traits are adequate representations of species-level change. We test the validity of this assumption by tallying the frequency with which traits vary in evolutionary mode within fossil species lineages. After fitting models of directional change, unbiased random walk, and stasis to a dataset of 635 traits across 153 species lineages, we find that within the majority of lineages, evolutionary mode varies across traits and the likelihood of conflicting within-lineage patterns increases with the number of traits analyzed. In addition, single traits may show variation in evolutionary mode even in situations where the overall morphological evolution of the lineage is dominated by one type of mode. These quantified, stratigraphi-cally based findings validate the idea that morphological patterns of mosaic evolution are pervasive across groups of organisms throughout Earth's history. integration | modularity | punctuated equilibrium | rate of evolution | trends Much focused of the on research processes on that stasis could and punctuated generate or equilibrium influence pat-has focused on processes that could generate or influence pat-terns of morphological evolution, including stabilizing selection (1, 2), metapopulation dynamics (3), environmental stability, habitat tracking, and stress (3-6). Recently, however, renewed discussions have highlighted the patterns themselves. These investigations largely fall into one of two categories, each focusing on a different aspect of the theory of punctuated equilibrium (7, 8). The first considers whether morphological evolution is concentrated at spe-ciation events or occurs gradually along branches of a phylogenetic tree. Here, methods applied to trees of extant taxa test whether the variance in phenotypes increases as a function of the number of speciation events (inferring a punctuational mode) or of total branch length, i.e., time (inferring a gradualist mode) (9-13). The second category distinguishes morphological evolutionary patterns within sequences of populations in the fossil record, particularly to determine the relative frequency of stasis compared with other modes of change. Recent methods either expand on earlier work in treating unbiased random walks as null hypotheses [e.g., Hurst measure (14), see ref. 15 for earlier work] or treat an unbiased random walk as a model of evolutionary change to be judged alongside other models using model selection criteria (16-18). What studies in both categories have in common is that the quantitative assessment of morphological change is mostly based on single traits, either size or shape. In our dataset of 635 sequences compiled from literature on the fossil record, only 17\% were de-rived using multivariate analysis of several traits (Dataset SI). The remaining sequences are comprised primarily of trait lengths and trait length:length ratios (Dataset SI). In many cases, more than one trait was measured from a sequence, but each was treated separately. Potential problems with this approach have been noted},

Yet, this objective has been addressed mainly in short-lived model species. Thus, expanding knowledge to nonmodel species with contrasting life histories, such as forest trees, appears necessary. To uncover the genetic basis of adaptation to climate in the widely distributed boreal conifer white spruce (Picea glauca), an environmental association study was conducted using 11,085 single nucleotide polymorphisms representing 7,819 genes, that is, approximately a quarter of the transcriptome.Linear and quadratic regressions controlling for isolation-by-distance, and the Random Forest algorithm, identified several dozen genes putatively under selection, among which 43 showed strongest signals along temperature and precipitation gradients. Most of them were related to temperature. Small to moderate shifts in allele frequencies were observed. Genes involved encompassed a wide variety of functions and processes, some of them being likely important for plant survival under biotic and abiotic environmental stresses according to expression data. Literature mining and sequence comparison also highlighted conserved sequences and functions with angiosperm homologs.Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions that local adaptation involves genes with small frequency shifts when selection is recent and gene flow among populations is high. Accordingly, genetic adaptation to climate in P. glauca appears to be complex, involving many independent and interacting gene functions, biochemical pathways, and processes. From an applied perspective, these results shall lead to specific functional/association studies in conifers and to the development of markers useful for the conservation of genetic resources.},

Location Altai Mountains, Russia. Methods Terrestrial snail assemblages, vegetation composition and selected environmental variables were recorded at 118 sites along a gradient of climatic continentality in the Russian Altai. Habitat characteristics of sites where species typical of the full-glacial period occurred were described using a classification tree. Results Seven of the eight species that are typical of central European full-glacial loess sediments were found in the study area. They were confined to cool areas with January mean temperatures below )17 ÓÄÇC, but occurred mainly in sheltered habitats with a warmer microclimate, such as scrub or open woodland. Pupilla loessica and Vallonia tenuilabris had the broadest habitat range, occurring from woodland to dry steppe. Unexpectedly, Columella columella, Pupilla alpicola, Vertigo genesii, V. parcedentata and V. pseudosubstriata were found mainly in wooded fens and shrubby tundra rather than in open steppe. Most of these seven species were recorded in base-rich wooded fens. Very dry open steppe habitats usually supported no snails. Main conclusions Habitat ranges of the studied snails in the Altai indicate that the full-glacial landscapes of central European lowlands that harboured these species were not completely dominated by open and dry loess steppe. Most probably they contained a significant component of shrubby vegetation, patches of wet habitats, and probably also areas of woodland at sites with a favourable mesoclimate.},

  abstract = {The phytochrome photoreceptors play important roles in the photoperiodic control of vegetative bud set, growth cessation, dormancy induction, and cold-hardiness in trees. Interestingly, ecotypic differences in photoperiodic responses are observed in many temperate-zone tree species. Northern and southern ecotypes of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. \& Gray), for example, exhibit marked differences in the timing of short-day-induced bud set and growth cessation, and these responses are controlled by phytochrome. Therefore, as a first step toward determining the molecular genetic basis of photoperiodic ecotypes in trees, we characterized the phytochrome gene (PHY) family in black cottonwood. We recovered fragments of one PHYA and two PHYB using PCR-based cloning and by screening a genomic library. Results from Southern analyses confirmed that black cottonwood has one PHYA locus and two PHYB loci, which we arbitrarily designated PHYB1 and PHYB2. Phylogenetic analyses which included PHY from black cottonwood, Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) suggest that the PHYB/D duplications in these species occurred independently. When Southern blots were probed with PHYC, PHYE, and PHYF heterologous probes, the strongest bands that we detected were those of black cottonwood PHYA and/or PHYB. These results suggest that black cottonwood lacks members of the PHYC/F and PHYE subfamilies. Although black cottonwood could contain additional PHY that are distantly related to known angiosperm PHY, our results imply that the PHY family of black cottonwood is less complex than that of other well-characterized dicot species such as Arabidopsis and tomato. Based on Southern analyses of five black cottonwood genotypes representing three photoperiodic ecotypes, substantial polymorphism was detected for at least one of the PHYB loci but not for the PHYA locus. The novel character of the PHY family in black cottonwood, as well as the differences in polymorphism we observed between the PHYA and PHYB subfamilies, indicates that a number of fundamental macro-and microevolutionary questions remain to be answered about the PHY family in dicots.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to winter cold in temperate and boreal trees involves complex genetic, physiological, and devel- opmental processes. Genecological studies demonstrate the existence of steep genetic clines for cold adaptation traits in relation to environmental (mostly temperature related) gradients. Population differentiation is generally stronger for cold adaptation traits than for other quantitative traits and allozymes. Therefore, these traits appear to be under strong natu- ral selection. Nonetheless, high levels of genetic variation persist within populations. The genetic control of cold adap- tation traits ranges from weak to strong, with phenological traits having the highest heritabilities. Within-population genetic correlations among traits range from negligible to moderate. Generally, bud phenology and cold hardiness in the fall are genetically uncorrelated with bud phenology and cold hardiness in the spring. Analyses of quantitative trait loci indicate that cold adaptation traits are mostly controlled by multiple genes with small effects and that quantitative trait loci \texttimes{} environment interactions are common. Given this inherent complexity, we suggest that future research should focus on identifying and developing markers for cold adaptation candidate genes, then using multilocus, multi- allelic analytical techniques to uncover the relationships between genotype and phenotype at both the individual and population levels. Ultimately, these methods may be useful for predicting the performance of genotypes in breeding programs and for better understanding the evolutionary ecology of forest trees. Key},

  abstract = {The advent of genomics and other `omics' has stimulated movement towards linking gene function and molecular mechanisms to whole-plant physiology, ecology and evolution. The impetus for this feature issue was the 12th New Phytologist Symposium, `Functional genomics of environmental adaptation in Populus' (DiFazio, 2005); hence, most papers in this issue focus on poplars or other forest trees. Although studies on the molecular basis of adaptation are progressing in Arabidopsis (Sten{\o}ien et al., 2002; McKay et al., 2003), and in other plants that are long-standing models of adaptive evolution (e.g. Mimulus; Bradshaw \& Schemske, 2003), studies on forest trees will have an important niche. Trees are good models for studying the genetics of adaptation because of their extensive natural populations with little confounding substructure, random mating, sufficient nucleotide diversity, rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium, economic importance and long history of ecological genetic research (Morgenstern, 1996; Neale \& Savolainen, 2004). Although difficulties in genetic transformation will constrain research in most forest trees, transformation is relatively easy in Populus, allowing hypotheses to be tested using controlled experimentation with homologous or heterologous gene insertion (Busov et al., pp. 9\textendash{}18; Man et al., pp. 31\textendash{}39; both in this issue). Furthermore, the availability of the complete genome sequence in Populus (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/ Poptr1.home.html) will unlock possibilities for ecological genetic research that were unforeseen just a few years ago. Despite this progress, a complete understanding of the molecular genetic basis of adaptation will require crossdisciplinary collaboration on a scale that has been rarely seen, including collaborations among experts in molecular biology, physiology, ecology, population biology, statistics and bioinformatics (Wright \& Gaut, 2004; DiFazio, 2005). Fortunately, this area is beginning to form the dendritic connections between diverse disciplines that are needed to answer some of the most fundamental questions in biology.},

  abstract = {Global warming is occurring more rapidly above the treeline than at lower elevations and alpine areas are predicted to experience above average warming in the future. Temperature is a primary factor in stimulating seed germination and regulating changes in seed dormancy status. Thus, plant regeneration from seed will be crucial to the persistence, migration and post disturbance recruitment of alpine plants in future climates. Here, we present the first assessment of the impact of soil warming on germination from the persistent alpine soil seed bank. Contrary to expectations, soil warming lead to reduced overall germination from the soil seed bank. However, germination response to soil temperature was species specific such that total species richness actually increased by nine with soil warming. We further explored the system by assessing the prevalence of seed dormancy and germination response to soil disturbance, the frequency of which is predicted to increase under climate change. Seeds of a significant proportion of species demonstrated physiological dormancy mechanisms and germination of several species appeared to be intrinsically linked to soil disturbance. In addition, we found no evidence of subalpine species and little evidence of exotic weed species in the soil, suggesting that the soil seed bank will not facilitate their invasion of the alpine zone. In conclusion, changes in recruitment via the alpine soil seed bank can be expected under climate change, as a result of altered dormancy alleviation and germination cues. Furthermore, the alpine soil seed bank, and the species richness therein, has the potential to help maintain local species diversity, support species range shift and moderate species dominance. Implications for alpine management and areas for further study are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors\textemdash{}agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor\textemdash{}increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1\textdegree{}C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). E conomically rational management of the global climate requires that the costs of re-ducing greenhouse gas emissions be weighed against the benefits of doing so (or, converse-ly, the costs of not doing so). A vast liter-ature has considered this problem, developing, among other insights, our understanding of the optimal timing of investments (1), the role of un-certainty (2), the importance of future adaptation (3), the role of trade (4), and the potentially large impact of unanticipated tipping points (5, 6). Integrated assessment models that value the bene-fits of greenhouse gas abatement are used by gov-ernments to estimate the social cost of climate change (7, 8), which in turn informs the design of greenhouse gas policies. However, the estima-ted benefits of greenhouse gas abatement\textemdash{}or conversely, the " damages " from climate change\textemdash{} are conceptually and computationally challeng-ing to construct. Because of this difficulty, previous analyses have relied on rough estimates, theorized effects, or limited process modeling at continen-tal scales or larger (9\textendash{}11), with no systematic cali-bration to observed human-climate linkages (12). Since the original development of these models, methodological innovations (13) coupled with data availability and computing power have fueled rapid growth in a spatially resolved, empirical un-derstanding of these relationships (14). Yet inte-grated assessments of climate change and their calculation of the social cost of carbon do not re-flect these advances (15\textendash{}17). Here, we develop an integrated architecture to compute potential economic damages from cli-mate change based on empirical evidence, which we apply to the United States. Our risk-based approach is grounded in empirical longitudinal analyses of nonlinear, sector-specific impacts, sup-plemented with detailed energy system, inunda-tion, and cyclone models. Built upon a calibrated distribution of downscaled climate models, this approach is probabilistic and highly resolved across geographic space while taking into account the spatial and sectoral covariance of impacts in each possible future. Our framework is designed to continuously integrate new empirical find-ings and new climate model projections as the supporting subfields of research advance in the future. When applied to the U.S. economy, this approach provides a probabilistic and empirically derived " damage function, " linking global mean surface temperature (GMST) to market and non-market costs in the United States, built up from empirical analyses using micro-level data.},

However, the effect of pollen limitation on the joint evolution of mating system and seed size is not known. Using an evolutionarily stable strategy resource allocation model, we show that where moderate pollen limitation and strong inbreeding depression select for complete outcrossing, pollen limitation should also increase the optimal seed size. In contrast, pollen limitation should not affect the optimal seed size under complete selfing, in which case ovule fertilization is certain. Under intermediate conditions, a mixed mating system evolves if the probability of ovule fertilization declines as more ovules are produced, so that a selfed seed with inbreeding depression provides equal marginal fitness returns to a larger outcrossed seed that may result from pollen limitation. Under mixed mating, outcrossed seeds should be larger than selfed seeds, and pollen limitation should not affect the optimal size of either outcrossed or selfed seeds. Our results identify a novel pathway through which pollen limitation selects for mixed mating and provide an adaptive explanation as to why selfed seeds are often smaller than outcrossed seeds.},

We used generalized linear mixed models to analyze pollen cone production in 180 permanent plots in Ontario, Canada between 1992 and 2008. Pollen cone production increased with stand age, and large trees in sparsely-populated stands produced more pollen cones. Defoliation decreased the propensity of trees to produce pollen cones for at least two years.Wealso identified important patterns that are not explained by defoliation and stand characteristics. Pollen cone production is spatially synchronized among years, trees in central Ontario produced more pollen cones than trees in northwestern Ontario, and background cone production increased over time in the central region but not in more northwestern plots. Synchronized reproduction is common among tree species, but has not previously been noted for jack pine pollen cones. Increasing cone production in central Ontario may be evidence of changing forest and (or) climatic conditions and deserves further investigation.

  abstract = {Light is never distributed homogeneously since it forms a gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the common theories on nutrient competition are not applicable to competition for light. In this paper, we investigate a model for light-limited growth and competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed water column. The model is based on standard assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics of growth and competition can be quantified not only in terms of depth but also directly in terms of light availability. We argue that the crucial measure for phytoplankton growth is not a "critical depth" but a "critical light intensity," I* ,. For each species, I*, corresponds to the equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water column when the species is grown in monoculture. I*, plays a role similar to the "critical nutrient concentration" R* used in models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant light supply, the species with the lowest I*, will competitively exclude all other species. There are, however, some important differences between R* and I* Whereas R* reflects both the local and the total balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient losses, I* t only reflects the total carbon balance. Moreover, I*, decreases with increasing light supply, whereas R* is independent of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the outcome of competition for light may depend on the light supply, (2) the compensation point is not a good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3) the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when species compete for both nutrients and light. The outcome of competition for nutrients and light may depend on the nutrient and light supply, on the mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to inanimate substances. Key-words: carbon balance: compensation point, competitive exclusion, light absorption: nutrient limitation; photosynthesis, phytoplankton: quantum Yield;resource competition; spatial heterogeneity'.},

We used statistically robust differences in guard cell size of modern plants and fossil leaves from packrat middens to map current and past distributions of these ploidy races since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Glacial/early Holocene (26-10 C-14 kyr BP or thousands of radiocarbon years before present) populations included diploids along the lower Rio Grande of west Texas, 650 km removed from sympatric diploids and tetraploids in the lower Colorado River Basin of south-eastern California/ south-western Arizona. Diploids migrated slowly from lower Rio Grande refugia with expansion into the northern Chihuahuan Desert sites forestalled until after similar to4.0 C-14 kyr Bp. Tetraploids expanded from the lower Colorado River Basin into the northern limits of the Sonoran Desert in central Arizona by 6.4 C-14 kyr BP. Hexaploids appeared by 8.5 C-14 kyr BP in the lower Colorado River Basin, reaching their northernmost limits (similar to 37 degreesN) in the Mohave Desert between 5.6 and 3.9 C-14 kyr BP. Modern diploid isolates may have resulted from both vicariant and dispersal events. In central Baja California and the lower Colorado River Basin, modern diploids probably originated from relict populations near glacial refugia. Founder events in the middle and late Holocene established diploid outposts on isolated limestone outcrops in areas of central and southern Arizona dominated by tetraploid populations. Geographic alignment of the three ploidy races along the modern gradient of increasingly drier and hotter summers is clearly a postglacial phenomenon, but evolution of both higher ploidy races must have happened before the Holocene. The exact timing and mechanism of polyploidy evolution in creosote bush remains a matter of conjecture.},

No climate change of similar magnitude has occurred since that event. The palaeoecological evidence of the response, especially of plants, to past climate change indicates that evolutionary adaptation has played no more than a minor role and that migration is the usual response of organisms to climate change. The individualism of response has important implications with respect to changes in the nature of vegetation and ecosystems. The maximum realized rates of migratory response by trees, although perhaps matching the maximum potential rates, are close to the maximum that it is believed can be achieved by such long-lived sessile organisms. The rate of climate change forecast for the future is 10-100 times faster than the rate of deglacial warming. Unless steps are taken to facilitate the migratory response of organisms to the forecast changes, then widespread extinction is likely. Artificial dispersal of trees and other organisms of limited dispersal and/or migratory capacity, the general extension of the legal protection currently afforded to some threatened organisms only within designated reserves, and the integration of wildlife habitat requirements and of wildlife corridors into human landscape utilization are all likely to be necessary. Stringent measures to limit the extent of future climate change by limiting emissions of greenhouse gases will also be necessary if the possibility of widespread and even catastrophic extinction is to be avoided.},

Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed.

With the ever-increasing speed of computers, the technique has increased in use due to its good performance in complex meteorological conditions. However, the method needs significant computer resources usually a supercomputer, to obtain statistically meaningful solutions of pollutant dispersion and mean concentration for sources in typical air sheds. The particle-puff (PARTPUFF) method proposed here uses a Gaussian puff solution in the horizontal directions and a particle solution for the vertical coordinate. This method allows a particle/puff to influence more than one horizontal grid point and so the total number of particles needed for a model run is reduced. The dispersion simulation still accounts for height-varying values of winds and turbulence in the same way as conventional particle models. The approach developed here has been verified by comparing results with a full particle model for the skewed convective boundary layer, and in complex terrain including a land-sea interface and a sinusoidal hill. The results from the PARTPUFF approach agree well with those from the full particle model. Particle numbers, memory, and computer time requirements are reduced by two orders of magnitude, making it feasible to use the model in a regulatory framework.},

  abstract = {When you did me the honor of asking me to fill your Society of Naturalists presidential chair, I accepted perhaps without duly considering the duties of the president of a society, founded largely to further the study of evolution, at the close of the year that marks the centenary of Darwin and Walleye initial presentation of the theory of natural selection. It seemed to me that most of the significant aspects of modern evolutionary theory have come either from geneticists, or from those heroic museum workers who suffering through years of neglect, were able to establish about 20 years ago what has come to be called the "new systematics." You had, however, chosen an ecologist as your president and one of that school at times supposed to study the environment without any relation to the organism. A few months later I happened to be in Sicily. An early interest in zoogeography and in aquatic insects led me to attempt to collect near Palermo, certain species of water-bugs, of the genus Corixa, described a century ago by Fieber and supposed to occur in the region, but never fully reinvestigated. It is hard to find suitable localities in so highly cultivated a landscape as the Concha d'Oro. Fortunately, I was driven up Monte Pellegrino, the hill that rises to the west of the city, to admire the view. A little below the summit, a church with a simple baroque facade stands in front of a cave in the limestone of the hill. Here in the 16th century a stalactite encrusted skeleton associated with a cross and twelve beads was discovered. Of this skeleton nothing is certainly known save that it is that of Santa Rosalia, a saint of whom little is reliably reported save that she seems to have lived in the 12th century, that her skeleton was found in this cave, and that she has been the chief patroness of Palermo ever since. Other limestone caverns on Monte Pellegrino had yielded bones of extinct Pleistocene Equus, and on the walls of one of the rock shelters at the bottom of the hill there are beautiful Gravettian engravings. Moreover, a small relic of the saint that I saw in the treasury of the Cathedral of Monreale has a venerable and petrified appearance, as might be expected. Nothing in her history being known to the contrary, perhaps for the moment we may take Santa Rosalia as the patroness of evolutionary studies, for just below the sanctuary, fed no doubt by the water that percolates through the limestone cracks of the mountain, and which formed the sacred cave, lies a small artificial pond, and when I could get to the pond a few weeks later, I got from it a hint of what I was looking for. Vast numbers of Corixidae were living in the water. At first I was rather disappointed because every specimen of the larger of the two species present was a female, and so lacking in most critical diagnostic features, while both sexes of the second slightly smaller species were present in about equal number. Examination of the material at leisure, and of the relevant literature, has convinced me that the two species are the common European C. punctata and C affinis, and that the peculiar Mediterranean species are illusionary. The larger C. punctata was clearly at the end of its breeding season, the smaller C. affinis was probably just beginning to breed. This is the sort of observation that any naturalist can and does make all the time. It was not until I asked myself why the larger species should breed first, and then the more general question as to why there should be two and not 20 or 200 species of the genus in the pond, that ideas suitable to present to you began to emerge. These ideas finally prompted the very general question as to why there are such an enormous number of animal species. There are at the present time supposed to be (Muller and Campbell, 1954; Hyman, 1955) about one million described species of animals. Of these about three-quarters are insects, of which a quite disproportionately large number are members of a single order, the Coleoptera.1 The marine fauna although it has at its disposal a much greater area than has the terrestrial, lacks this astonishing diversity (Thorson, 1958). If the insects are excluded, it would seem to be more diverse. The proper answer to my initial question would be to develop a theory at least predicting an order of magnitude for the number of species of 106 rather than 108 or 104. This I certainly cannot do. At most it is merely possible to point out some of the factors which would have to be considered if such a theory was ever to be constructed. Before developing my ideas I should like to say that I subscribe to the view that the process of natural selection, coupled with isolation and later mutual invasion of ranges leads to the evolution of sympatric species, which at equilibrium occupy distinct niches, according to the Volterra-Gause principle. The empirical reasons for adopting this view and the correlative view that the boundaries of realized niches are set by competition are mainly in direct. So far as niches may be defined in terms of food, the subject has been carefully considered by Lack (1954). In general all the indirect evidence is in accord with the view, which has the advantage of confirming theoretical expectation. Most of the evidence is in accord with the view, which has the advantage of confirming theoretical expectation. Most of the opinions that have been held to the contrary appear to be due to misunderstandings and to loose formulation of the problem (Hutchinson, 1958). In any study of evolutionary ecology, food relations appear as one of the most important aspects of the system of animate nature. There is quite obviously much more to living communities than the raw dictum "eat or be eaten," but in order to understand the higher intricacies of any ecological system, it is most easy to start from this crudely simple point of view.},

Nutrient concentrations in the fruit (skin, flesh and seeds inclusive) declined throughout the season. For B, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, S and Zn, concentrations declined sharply within the first 8 weeks of growth, then more gradually in the subsequent 12 weeks until harvest. The concentrations of Ca, N and P, on the other hand, tended to decline regularly throughout the growth period. Small differences were noted between concentrations when fruit at equivalent stages of development were compared over both seasons. However the trends in the concentration changes were similar, the only exception being K, where in one season they fluctuated in an irregular manner, whereas in the other there was a regular decline. The quantities of all nutrients in fruit increased throughout the season, the magnitude of the increase diminishing with time. The greatest rate of accumulation of each element occurred during the first 8 weeks of growth. There was no apparent difference in the pattern of B, Mg, K, S or Zn accumulation in either season. For Cu, Fe, Mn, N, P and especially Ca, the patterns were influenced to some extent by season. Lesser amounts of these nutrients accumulated during early growth (first 8 weeks after pollination) in the drier season than in the wetter year. The results are compared with the nutrient accumulation characteristics of fruit of other crops. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

  abstract = {Predicting vegetation shifts under climate change is a challenging endeavor, given the complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables that influence demographic rates. To determine how current trends and variation in climate change affect seedling establishment, we analyzed demographic responses to spatiotemporal variation to temperature and soil moisture in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We monitored seedling establishment for 10 years in five plots located along an elevational gradient of five dominant tree species: Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, and Quercus rubra. A hierarchical Bayes model allowed us to incorporate different sources of information, observation errors, and the inherent variability of the establishment process. From our analysis, spring temperatures and heterogeneity in soil moisture emerge as key drivers, and they act through nonlinear population demographic processes. We found that all species benefited from warmer springs, in particular the species found on dry slopes, N. sylvatica, and those dominant at higher elevations, Betula spp. and Q. rubra. This last species also benefited from dry environments. Conversely, L. tulipifera, which is abundant on mesic sites, experienced highest establishment rates at high moisture. The mechanisms behind these results may differ among species. Higher temperatures are apparently more important for some, while dry conditions and reduced pathogenic attacks on their seeds and new seedlings have a large impact for others. Our results suggest that only communities found at higher elevations are in danger of regional extinction when their habitats disappear given the current climatic trends. We conclude that the recruitment dynamics of the communities where these species are dominant could be affected by minor changes in climate in ways that cannot be predicted using only climate envelopes, which use different variables and miss the nonlinearities.},

  abstract = {The effect of elevated atmospheric CO 2  concentration on the growth of shoots, roots, mycorrhizas and extraradical mycorrhizal mycelia of pine (Pinus silvestris L.) was examined. Two and a half-month-old seedlings were inoculated axenically with the mycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tincto-rius (Pers.) by a method allowing rapid mycorrhiza formation in Petri dishes. The plants were then cultivated for 3 months in growth chambers with daily concentrations of 350 and 600 {$\mu$}mol mol -1  CO 2  during the day. Whereas plants harvested after 1 and 2 months did not differ appreciably between ambient and increased CO 2  concentrations, after 3 months they developed a considerably higher root biomass (\%57\%) at elevated CO 2 , but did not increase significantly in root length. The mycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius, which depended entirely on the plant assimilates in the model system, grew much faster at increased CO 2 : 3 times more mycorrhizal root clusters were formed and the extraradical mycelium produced had twice the biomass at elevated as at ambient CO 2 . No difference in shoot biomass was found between the two treatments after 91 d. However, since the total water consumption of seedlings was similar in the two treatments, the water use efficiency was appreciably higher for the seedlings at increased CO 2  because of the higher below-ground biomass.

  abstract = {Calendar date of the beginning of the growing season at high altitude in the Colorado Rocky Mountains is variable but has not changed significantly over the past 25 years. This result differs from growing evidence from low altitudes that climate change is resulting in a longer growing season, earlier migrations, and earlier reproduction in a variety of taxa. At our study site, the beginning of the growing season is controlled by melting of the previous winter's snowpack. Despite a trend for warmer spring temperatures the average date of snowmelt has not changed, perhaps because of the trend for increased winter precipitation. This disjunction between phenology at low and high altitudes may create problems for species, such as many birds, that migrate over altitudinal gradients. We present data indicating that this already may be true for American robins, which are arriving 14 days earlier than they did in 1981; the interval between arrival date and the first date of bare ground has grown by 18 days. We also report evidence for an effect of climate change on hibernation behavior; yellow-bellied marmots are emerging 38 days earlier than 23 years ago, apparently in response to warmer spring air temperatures. Migrants and hibernators may experience problems as a consequence of these changes in phenology, which may be exacerbated if climate models are correct in their predictions of increased winter snowfall in our study area. The trends we report for earlier formation of permanent snowpack and for a longer period of snow cover also have implications for hibernating species.},

At estuarine stations the respiration rate of Macoma balthica (L.) (Baltic clam) did not show interseasonal changes, indicating seasonal acclimation, but within the season the respiration increased with increasing temperature, indicating the absence of short-term acclimation. In clams translocated from the Netherlands towards the Bidasoa estuary, 200 km South of their Southern distribution limit, their respiration rate was higher and weight-index lower than in specimens living in Dutch estuaries. Irrespective of an effect of the temperature, clams exposed in experiments to water from Bidasoa showed a higher respiration than clams exposed to water from the other stations. Moreover, at non-estuarine stations with a low food content, the clams showed reversed acclimation, i.e., the respiration rates in winter were much lower than summer rates, most probably a strategy to conserve energy by means of a depressed metabolism. A weight index of 5 mg DW/cm3and glycogen content of 2\% DW are suggested as the minimal values below which the metabolic energy balance of Baltic clams becomes more negative and the clam population disappears. It was concluded that factors other than temperature influenced the respiration and weight-index of clams, and hence their presence or absence, e.g., food concentration, innate seasonal cycles, and possible pollutants in the water.

In common garden experiments, the majority of plants grown from seeds or seedlings collected in Kentucky, Alabama, Virginia, Ohio, and Missouri were monocarpic, but some were dicarpic, tricarpic or polycarpic. Observations in natural populations of P. canadensis suggested that there is variation in the life history of this species throughout its geographic range. Anthesis date and height of plants at anthesis were significantly different between mesic and dry field sites in central Kentucky populations, but common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments showed that these were due mainly to environmental (and not to genetic) effects. The latter was also true for age of maturity and rate of change in plant height. Lack of significant site \texttimes{} source interaction for these characters indicated that plants did not differ in their plastic responses between sources at each site. Winter annual, biennial, triennial, and dicarpic and tricarpic perennial life histories occurred within populations in both common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. In the latter experiments, most matured plants were either biennials (most common) or winter annuals (second most common), with the order reversed in the former experiments due to a more benign environment favoring earlier maturity. The extensive phenotypic plasticity displayed by P. canadensis for phenology and life history enables the species to inhabit a wide range of environments. CR  - Copyright \&\#169; 2002 Springer},

The other two species for which we had vertical profiles in both abundance (realized niche) and growth of transplants (fundamental niche) showed some potentially important discrepancies between the two niche spaces. Usnea peaked in abundance at the highest levels in the canopy, but appeared to reach a maximum growth rate at about 30 m. The treetop environment is evidently ideal for Usnea, and its capacity for rapid growth suggests that it is a vigorous competitor. Lobaria oregana peaked in abundance at 25-30 m, while its growth rates were maximal considerably higher in the canopy, at 40-45 m. We must conclude that some aspect of establishment or competition has a pronounced negative effect on L. oregana above about 35 m in the 65-m-high canopy. Further experiments are needed to test the hypotheses that these cyanolichens fail in the upper canopy because of competition, or that they fail by an inability to tolerate rare microclimatic extremes, such as low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has helped restore hundreds of wetlands in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, in an effort to enhance the production of waterfowl and other wetland associated species. During summer 2004, we re-examined I I restorations to determine how their plant communities had changed since 1992. In addition, we re-evaluated waterfowl and anuran communities at eight restorations. Because 1992 data were compiled from separate studies, all three groups of organisms were simultaneously examined at only two wetlands. Significant decreases in plant diversity and plant species richness were detected between 1992 and 2004, while significant increases were detected for species classified as obligate or facultative wet. These changes suggest that the plant communities at the restorations have matured since 1992. Use of the wetlands by waterfowl and anurans, on the other hand, did not exhibit significant change over this period. Regular monitoring of restorations over even longer periods will provide new insights into the way in which restored communities develop and whether current restoration methods have succeeded in establishing stable, species-rich wetland communities.},

  abstract = {Southern British Columbia, Canada, is the northwestern range limit of the American badger (Taxidea taxus) and supports a nationally endangered subspecies. We initially investigated space-use, diet, and demography in southeastern British Columbia to characterize range-limit ecology. Resident badgers in the northern part (NP) of our study area were extirpated or nearly so during our study (lambda = 0.7), whereas the southern (SP) badger population remained viable (lambda = 1.2). This apparent difference in viability between NP and SP may have been confounded by timing because research occurred later in SP; litter size, number of Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) consumed, and home range size were each correlated nearly equally to latitude and date of research, and survivorship was greater later in the study for both the NP and SP. Collectively, these factors indicated temporal, not just spatial, variability. Therefore, we translocated badgers into the NP to 1) determine whether the NP had lost its capacity to support badgers or had merely experienced the variability expected at a range limit and, if the latter, 2) initiate recovery. Translocated animals and their offspring had kit production equivalent to that of SP residents, adult survivorship intermediate between the NP and SP residents, and no confirmed kit mortality, with population growth projected (lambda = 1.3). Diet of translocated individuals was similar to that of residents. Home ranges of translocated females were intermediate between the 2 resident groups, and home ranges of translocated males were not different than either resident group. juvenile dispersal dates and distances were similar to those of residents for each sex. Our results were consistent with the extirpation of the NP being driven by temporally variable conditions or the effect of random events expected at range limits. The extirpation of NP did not appear to have been primarily due to any permanent loss of the NP's capacity to support badgers. At 3.5 years after starting translocations, badgers remained in the NP within an apparently growing population. We found translocation to be a useful diagnostic and conservation tool for badgers at their northern limit. Its utility may extend to countering the fluctuations typical of other rare, range-limit species.},

  abstract = {To develop a better understanding of how biodiversity loss and productivity are related, we need to consider ecologically realistic rarity (i.e. reduced evenness and increased dominance) and extinction (i.e. reduced richness) scenarios. Furthermore, we need to identify and better understand the factors that influence species and community yielding behaviors because the general conditions for overyielding are the same as those for coexistence. We established experimental tallgrass prairie plots in Iowa to determine how two ecologically realistic rarityextinction scenarios influenced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and disassembly. Equal-mass seedlings of six tallgrass prairie species were transplanted into field plots to establish realistic declining species evenness (high, medium, low) and richness (4, 1) treatments. Across declining evenness treatments, the relative abundance of the ubiquitous tall species Andropogon gerardii increased, the relative abundance of the tall species Salvia azurea was constant, and the relative abundance of two short (dissimilar height scenario) or two tall species (tall scenario) decreased. Monocultures of Andropogon represented a continuation of this trend until there was complete dominance by Andropogon and extinction of all other species. Our treatments also allowed us to test if variation in plant height contributes to the complementarity effect. Niche partitioning in plant height was not positively related to complementarity. The effects of declining species evenness and richness on the diversityproductivity relationship were different for these two ecologically realistic rarityextinction scenarios. Specifically, as diversity declined across treatments, ANPP and the selection effects decreased in tall communities, but not in dissimilar communities. Additionally, differences between these two scenarios revealed that decreased species yielding behavior is associated with two tallgrass prairie extinction risk factors, rarity and short height. The differences between these scenarios demonstrate the importance of incorporating the known patterns of diversity declines into future studies.},

  abstract = {Aims Alpine tree line ecotones are harsh environments where low temperatures constrain tree regeneration and growth. However, the expected upward shift of tree line ecotones in response to climate warming has not been ubiquitous. The lack of coupling between tree line dynamics and climate warming might be explained by factors other than climate variation that determine seedling recruitment in these ecotones. We want to assess how the availability of suitable habitat for establishment and the effects of facilitation on seedling survival and growth affect tree recruitment within tree line ecotones and modulate their responses to climate. Location We evaluate the relevance of these factors for Pinus uncinata tree line ecotones in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain) and Andorra. Methods We analysed the microhabitat of naturally established seedlings in rectangular plots at the tree line ecotone, assessing the habitat type and the proximity to potentially protective elements that may improve microsite conditions. We tested whether krummholz individuals influence regeneration at the tree line by performing a transplantation field experiment to evaluate the extent of facilitation on seedling survival and growth in height. A total of 820 seedlings were transplanted at different distances and orientations (resulting in 12 positions) from krummholz mats and monitored over 2 years. Results Safe sites for P. uncinata recruits consisted of sparse vegetation covering bare soil, gravel or litter, and close to protective elements that may ameliorate microsite conditions. The field experiment showed that directional positive interactions enhance seedling survival and growth, altering the spatial patterns of recruit survivor-ship, especially during harsh winter conditions (shallow and irregular snowpack). Main conclusions Our results suggest that scarce availability of safe sites and uneven facilitation by krummholz control seedling recruitment patterns within alpine tree line ecotones. Such constraints may distort or counter the response of tree line ecotones to climate warming at local and regional scales.},

Projections typically assume that temperature is a primary fitness determinant and that populations near the poleward (and upward) range boundary are preadapted to warming. Thus, poleward, peripheral populations will increase with warming, and these increases facilitate poleward range expansions. We tested the assumption that poleward, peripheral populations are enhanced by warming using 2 butterflies (Erynnis propertius and Papilio zelicaon) that co-occur and have contrasting degrees of host specialization and interpopulation genetic differentiation. We performed a reciprocal translocation experiment between central and poleward, peripheral populations in the field and simulated a translocation experiment that included alternate host plants. We found that the performance of both central and peripheral populations of E. propertius were enhanced during the summer months by temperatures characteristic of the range center but that local adaptation of peripheral populations to winter conditions near the range edge could counteract that enhancement. Further, poleward range expansion in this species is prevented by a lack of host plants. In P. zelicaon, the fitness of central and peripheral populations decreased under extreme summer temperatures that occurred in the field at the range center. Performance in this species also was affected by an interaction of temperature and host plant such that host species strongly mediated the fitness of peripheral individuals under differing simulated temperatures. Altogether we have evidence that facilitation of poleward range shifts through enhancement of peripheral populations is unlikely in either study species.},

  abstract = {1. In deciduous forests, herb distribution patterns can shift dramatically across topographical gradients, yet it remains unclear whether topographical associations reflect regeneration niche differences that arise during early life-history stages.  2. We examined: (i) whether seedling recruitment patterns were consistent with topographical distributions of established populations and (ii) how environmental heterogeneity at two spatial scales influences spatial patterns of seedling recruitment in four shade-adapted forest herbs (Actaea racemosa, Hydrastis canadensis, Panax quinquefolius and Sanguinaria canadensis), which are harvested from the wild for their medicinal properties but differ in life histories and seed mass. Topographical distributions were quantified in transect surveys of forest stands, and then seed was experimentally transplanted into litter microenvironments (bare, shallow and deep) on opposing topographical positions (NE-facing cove forest and SW-facing oak forest).  3. Forest herbs that were more frequent in moist NE-facing cove forests (A. racemosa, H. canadensis and S. canadensis) suffered higher mortality when their seeds were dispersed into the drier SW-facing oak forest, although the stages that limited recruitment differed among species.  4. For A. racemosa and S. canadensis, the selectivity of the slope topographical filter varied in strength among years that differed in soil moisture. Seedling distributions expanded across the topographical gradient during a `wet' year but contracted during a `dry' year.  5. Litter effects were often context-dependent. Litter-removing disturbance increased seedling recruitment of H. canadensis, but only in the NE-facing cove forest. When soil moisture was limiting in either space or time, microenvironments where litter was present tended to enhance emergence and/or survival relative to litter-free microenvironments.  6. For P. quinquefolius, which has been harvested from the wild for over 200 years, seed limitation is a fundamental constraint on its distribution along a topographical moisture gradient. Across all microenvironments, the net recruitment rate of P. quinquefolius, the largest-seeded and least abundant species, was an order of magnitude greater than that of A. racemosa, the smallest-seeded and most abundant species.  7. Synthesis. Many shade-adapted forest herbs are declining in abundance due to anthropogenic factors. Conservation efforts must consider dispersal limitation in the spatial context of environmental filters that can vary in strength and quality over time.},

  abstract = {Determining limitations on poleward range expansion is important for predicting how climate change will alter the distribution of species. For most species, it is not known what factors set their distributional limits and the role dispersal limitation might play if range-limiting factors were altered. We conducted a transplant study of three related and co-occurring Lomatium species at their northern range limits to test competing hypotheses of range limitation. We added seeds to experimental plots inside and outside the species' geographic range (a regional treatment) in a replicated design with vegetation intact and vegetation reduced (a disturbance treatment) and with herbivore access and herbivore exclusion (an herbivory treatment). Germination and reemergence were measured through two growing seasons, along with community-level variables. A fully-crossed linear mixed model revealed that Lomatium survivorship outside the current range was as good or better than survivorship within the range, at least when the vegetative community remained intact. This suggests that the species are dispersal limited. Germination often was improved in the presence of an intact vegetative community, but this potentially facilitative effect was absent in second-year reemergence. Plots exposed to herbivory had slightly, but significantly, reduced germination, though reemergence did not differ between herbivore treatments. Lomatium dissectum, a rare species, had significantly lower survivorship than its congeners, suggesting that range shifts in rare taxa may be particularly difficult. Seed additions beyond species' range limits may be a strategy for overcoming dispersal limitation and assisting species in poleward migrations.},

  abstract = {1. Models of local stable coexistence require negative feedbacks, i.e. intraspecific interactions must be more negative than interspecific interactions. However, most competition experiments, often done in the glasshouse, have found evidence for competitive hierarchies. Measurement of interactions under realistic field conditions is necessary to assess their contribution to community dynamics, and explicit measurement of intermediaries thought to be important in interactions may allow studies to account for any variation in experimental results. 2. In this study, we compare conspecific and heterospecific interactions in a field experiment in a dry sand prairie in Michigan. We study the four dominant species at two different stages, germination and adult growth. Using seed addition and adult transplant experiments, we ask whether plants perform best in natural field monocultures of conspecifics, heterospecifics or no neighbour plots. We also measure abiotic environmental characteristics associated with each neighbourhood type and test whether performance can be explained by environmental effects. We hypothesize that plants will create competitive hierarchies because our experimental design is similar to classic competition experiments. 3. Neighbour species created consistent hierarchies in their effects on germination of all four target species, which is likely due to light limitation. However, interestingly, adult plant biomass for two of the three species (one species did not survive) was lower in conspecific monocultures compared to heterospecific or no neighbour plots, thus producing negative feedbacks. For two species, the effects of neighbours on adult growth are likely due to reduction of light and soil nitrate; for the third, however, resources could not explain the pattern that conspecific interactions were more negative than heterospecific. 4.Synthesis. These results suggest that patterns in the relative strength of conspecific and heterospecific competition depend on life-history stage. Moreover, resource uptake could explain some, but not all, of the interactions among species, suggesting that other factors such as microbial communities or other forms of niche partitioning may play a role and that field experiments are necessary to gauge their relative importance.},

  abstract = {Question Thorny shrubs play keystone roles in grazed ecosystems by defending non-protected plants against herbivores, but their establishment in grazed ecosystems is poorly understood. Which factors control establishment of recruits of thorny nurse shrubs in grazed temperate woodlands? Location Ancient grazed temperate woodlands (52 degrees 32'N, 6 degrees 36'E), The Netherlands. Methods We surveyed biotic and abiotic factors for saplings of thorny nurse shrubs in plots with and without saplings. To disentangle these factors, we performed a transplantation experiment over two growing seasons with nurse shrub saplings (Prunus spinosa and Crataegus monogyna) planted in two dominant vegetation types - tall unpalatable swards and short grazed lawns - half of them protected from herbivory via exclosures. Results Plots with shrub saplings had taller surrounding vegetation, higher soil pH and higher soil moisture than plots without saplings. These plots predominantly contained unpalatable sward species, while plots without saplings mainly contained palatable lawn species. After transplantation, sapling survival was higher in exclosures than in the open, and higher in sward exclosures than in lawn exclosures. Sapling growth was higher in swards than in lawns, higher inside than outside exclosures, and higher for Prunus than Crataegus, while browsing on saplings was higher in lawns. Conclusion Unpalatable swards form essential establishment niches for thorny shrubs in grazed temperate woodlands: they protect against herbivores before thorns fully develop in saplings, and sapling growth is better due to improved micro-environmental conditions. Once established and thorny, shrub saplings grow out of the protective range of the swards and in turn facilitate tree seedlings, which are essential for long-term persistence of grazed temperate woodlands. This study shows that nurse plants may start as proteges before becoming facilitators for other plants in a later life stage. This may be common for nurse plants in various ecosystems. We argue that improved understanding of establishment of nurse plants and their constraining factors is crucial for effective conservation and restoration in various ecosystems.},

In two field experiments, we transplanted T. chinensis seedlings into salt marsh, transitional zone and upland habitats, manipulated neighbours and quantified survivorship and biomass to examine neighbour effects. We also quantified vegetation effects on abiotic conditions in each zone.Results: Tamarix chinensis dominated the transitional zone, but was absent in upland and salt marsh habitats. In the pot experiment, T. chinensis grew well in freshwater treatments, but was inhibited by increasing salinity. Field experiments revealed that competition from neighbours limited T. chinensis growth in the uplands, while T. chinensis transplants were limited, with or without neighbours, in the salt marsh by high soil salinity. In the transitional zone, however, T. chinensis transplants performed better with than without neighbours. Vegetation removal significantly elevated soil salinity in the transitional zone, but not in other zones.Conclusions: Competition, facilitation and abiotic stress are all important in mediating the zonation of T. chinensis. Within its physiological stress tolerance range, or fundamental niche, it is limited by plant competition in low salinity habitats, and facilitated by neighbours in high salt stress habitats, but cannot survive in salt marshes having salinities above its salt stress tolerance limit. Our results have implications for understanding the relationships between facilitation and stress gradients.},

Elymus athericus, a clonal grass of north-western European salt marshes, is currently increasing in abundance and invading new habitats. In this study, we analyzed controlling factors for seedling establishment of E. athericus in frequently flooded low marsh habitats. Here, biotic and abiotic conditions are very different from the conditions of the parental sites with established populations higher up in the marsh. Hence, we hypothesized that seedling establishment at the expanding low marsh edge would depend on the parental origin (either through maternal effects or heritable local adaptation). We further hypothesized that seedling origin interacts with biotic factors such as herbivory and competition as well as with abiotic factors like inundation frequency. We tested the dependence of seedling survival, growth and vegetative reproduction on these factors in a factorial transplant experiment on Schiermonnikoog. Survival was high, with 77\% of the planted seedling surviving until the end of the experiment. Biotic factors had a much stronger effect on seedling growth and mortality than parental origin and were independent of inundation. However, parental origin strongly interacted with herbivory and competition, with seedlings performing better under the conditions that resembled their parental site.We conclude that seedlings of E. athericus, a species that was previously thought to occur only in mid- to high marsh elevation, can establish at a frequently inundated low-marsh sites. Long term survival and further invasion will primarily depend on biotic factors in interaction with seed origin. Our results suggest that next to herbivory, limitation of seeds adapted to colonizing conditions is likely to slow down range expansion. \textcopyright{} 2011 Gesellschaft f{\"u}r {\"O}kologie.},

Across all species, CO2 enrichment (500-800 mul l(-1)) resulted in more flowers (+19\%), more fruits (+18\%), more seeds (+16\%), greater individual seed mass (+4\%), greater total seed mass (+25\%), and lower seed nitrogen concentration, (N) (-14\%). Crops and undomesticated (wild) species did not differ in total mass response to elevated CO2 (+31\%), but crops allocated more mass to reproduction and produced more fruits (+28\% vs +4\%) and seeds (+21\% vs +4\%) than did wild species when grown at high CO2. Seed [N] was not affected by high CO2 concentrations in legumes, but declined significantly in most nonlegumes. Our results provide robust estimates of average plant reproductive responses to CO2 enrichment and demonstrate important differences among individual taxa and among functional groups. In particular, crops were more responsive to elevated CO2 than were wild species. These differences and the substantial decline in seed [N] in many species have broad implications for the functioning of future natural and agro-ecosystems.},

Phenological observations and measurements of height and stem diameter growth, absolute and relative growth rates, starch and soluble carbohydrate concentrations of the needles, and crown structure and needle properties were made at frequent intervals throughout the two growing seasons. Elevated CO(2) significantly advanced the date of bud burst in both years. The increase in total needle area in response to elevated CO(2) was accounted for by longer shoots and an increase in individual needle area in the first year, and by an increase in the number and length of shoots in the second year. Stem diameter and tree height were enhanced more by the elevated CO(2) treatment in the first year than in the second, indicating a decreased effect of CO(2) on growth over time. This was confirmed by a study of absolute and relative growth rates of leader shoots. During the first growing season of CO(2) enrichment, mean weekly relative growth rates over the growing season (RGR(m)) were significantly enhanced. During the second year, RGR(m) in ambient CO(2) closely matched that in elevated CO(2).},

By contrast, plant extinctions since the Middle Pleistocene are undocumented, suggesting that plant species have been able to respond to environmental changes of the past several glacial/interglacial cycles by migration. We provide evidence from morphological studies of fossil cones and anatomical studies of fossil needles that a now-extinct species of spruce (Picea critchfieldii sp. nov.) was widespread in eastern North America during the Last Glacial Maximum. P. critchfieldii was dominant in vegetation of the Lower Mississippi Valley, and extended at least as far east as western Georgia. P. critchfieldii disappeared during the last deglaciation, and its extinction is not directly attributable to human activities.

Predicting ecological and biogeographic responses to these changes constitutes an immense challenge for ecologists. Perspectives from climatic and ecological history indicate that responses will be laden with contingencies, resulting from episodic climatic events interacting with demographic and colonization events. This effect is compounded by the dependency of environmental sensitivity upon life-stage for many species. Climate variables often used in empirical niche models may become decoupled from the proximal variables that directly influence individuals and populations. Greater predictive capacity, and more-fundamental ecological and biogeographic understanding, will come from integration of correlational niche modeling with mechanistic niche modeling, dynamic ecological modeling, targeted experiments, and systematic observations of past and present patterns and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter biotic interactions, and may lead to temporal and spatial mismatches of interacting species. Although the importance of interactions for climate change risk assessments is increasingly acknowledged in observational and experimental studies, biotic interactions are still rarely incorporated in species distribution models. We assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the obligate interaction between Aeshna viridis and its egg-laying plant Stratiotes aloides in Europe, based on an ensemble modelling technique. We compared three different approaches for incorporating biotic interactions in distribution models: (1) We separately modelled each species based on climatic information, and intersected the future range overlap ('overlap approach'). (2) We modelled the potential future distribution of A. viridis with the projected occurrence probability of S. aloides as further predictor in addition to climate ('explanatory variable approach'). (3) We calibrated the model of A. viridis in the current range of S. aloides and multiplied the future occurrence probabilities of both species ('reference area approach'). Subsequently, all approaches were compared to a single species model of A. viridis without interactions. All approaches projected a range expansion for A. viridis. Model performance on test data and amount of range gain differed depending on the biotic interaction approach. All interaction approaches yielded lower range gains (up to 667\% lower) than the model without interaction. Regarding the contribution of algorithm and approach to the overall uncertainty, the main part of explained variation stems from the modelling algorithm, and only a small part is attributed to the modelling approach. The comparison of the no-interaction model with the three interaction approaches emphasizes the importance of including obligate biotic interactions in projective species distribution modelling. We recommend the use of the 'reference area approach' as this method allows a separation of the effect of climate and occurrence of host plant.},

In contrast to what is usually hypothesised, no positive relationship was found between the distribution and abundance of C. vulgaris within the regions, and between regions there was a negative relationship between large-scale distribution and local abundance. A seed-sowing and transplantation experiment suggested that there is no difference in the amount of suitable but unoccupied habitats between the regions, and unoccupied sites were more favourable than occupied sites. The mechanism behind the observed abundance distribution pattern in C. vulgaris could be either a time-lag in population change response, or a negative correlation in resources between the regions.},

This increased root length may have lead to a more intensive soil exploration. Chemical analysis of the roots showed that the roots in the elevated treatment accumulated more starch and had a lower C/N-ratio. Specific root respiration rates were significantly higher in the elevated treatment and this was probably attributed to increased nitrogen concentrations in the roots. Rhizospheric respiration and soil CO2 efflux were also enhanced in the elevated treatment.

Donor brain death duration (BDD) may impact post-transplant graft function and survival in lung transplantation.
Methods
We queried the 2007-2018 United Network for Organ Sharing Registry for adult recipients undergoing first-time isolated lung transplantation. Cox Proportional Hazard modelling with splines enabled identification of three donor brain death intervals for subsequent analysis: short ({$<$}24 hours), reference (24-60 hours), and long ({$>$}60 hours). The primary outcome was post-transplant survival.
Results
19,721 donors and recipients met inclusion criteria. Median time from donor brain death until cross clamp was 36.6 hours (IQR 19.5). Unadjusted overall survival between cohorts was equivalent (log-rank p=0.42), however longer BDD was associated with improved bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)-free survival (log-rank p{$<$}0.001). On multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards regression, BDD was not associated with recipient survival (p{$>$}0.05). Similarly, logistic regression did not identify an independent association between BDD and primary graft dysfunction (PGD) (p{$>$}0.05). Increased BDD was, however, associated with a decreased risk of acute rejection (long vs reference, adjusted OR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.64-0.94) and improved BOS-free survival (long vs reference, adjusted HR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.81-0.96).
Conclusions
Donor BDD is not associated with post-transplant survival or PGD. Long donor BDD, however, is associated with a decreased risk for acute rejection and improved BOS-free survival. Therefore, lung allografts from donors with a prolonged length of time from brain death until explant should not be viewed less favorably by donor selection centers.},

Although appealing, these models ignore the genetic structure of species, and the fact that different populations might respond in different ways because of adaptation to their environment. Here, we introduced ancestry distribution models, that is, statistical models of the spatial distribution of ancestry proportions, for forecasting intra-specific changes based on genetic admixture instead of species occurrence data. Using multi-locus genotypes and extensive geographic coverage of distribution data across the European Alps, we applied this approach to 20 alpine plant species considering a global increase in temperature from 0.25 to 4 \textdegree{}C. We forecasted the magnitudes of displacement of contact zones between plant populations potentially adapted to warmer environments and other populations. While a global trend of movement in a north-east direction was predicted, the magnitude of displacement was species-specific. For a temperature increase of 2 \textdegree{}C, contact zones were predicted to move by 92 km on average (minimum of 5 km, maximum of 212 km) and by 188 km for an increase of 4 \textdegree{}C (minimum of 11 km, maximum of 393 km). Intra-specific turnover-measuring the extent of change in global population genetic structure-was generally found to be moderate for 2 \textdegree{}C of temperature warming. For 4 \textdegree{}C of warming, however, the models indicated substantial intra-specific turnover for ten species. These results illustrate that, in spite of unavoidable simplifications, ancestry distribution models open new perspectives to forecast population genetic changes within species and complement more traditional distribution-based approaches.},

  abstract = {There are a number of evolutionary hypotheses about why species distributions are limited, but very little empirical information to test them. We present data examining whether the southern distribution of Drosophila serrata is limited by cold responses. Species comparisons were undertaken for cold resistance, development time, and viability at 15{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}C and 25{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}C for D. serrata and other species with a more southerly distribution (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. immigrans). Relative to the other species, D. serrata had a long development time at both temperatures and a low level of cold resistance. Using isofemale lines collected in different seasons, central and marginal populations were compared for cold resistance, as well as development time and viability at 14{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}C. The border population had a relatively higher resistance to cold shock in postwinter collections, but there was no population differentiation for prewinter collections or for the other traits. The presence of variation among isofemale lines within the border populations suggests that genetic variation as measured in the laboratory is unlikely to limit range expansion. Population cages were used in the field to determine if D. serrata persisted over winter at borders. Although all cages yielded adult offspring at northern sites, only a few produced offspring at or just south of the border. In contrast, all cages with D. simulans produced adult offspring, suggesting that climatic factors limited D. serrata numbers. Offspring from surviving adults showed a phenotypic trade-off between fecundity and cold resistance. Comparisons of the cold resistance of field males and females with their laboratory-reared offspring provided evidence for heritable variation in field-reared flies. Overall, the results suggest that cold stress is important in limiting the southern distribution of D. serrata, but it seems unlikely that a lack of genetic variation restricts range expansion.},

Palmer (2000) has already shown that the problem of publication bias is especially severe for h\# because negative values are biologically irrelevant and therefore under-reported. We found 40 peer-reviewed meta-analyses where we could also obtain effect sizes and variances for the original studies (either because they were included as appendices in the published paper or where the authors kindly responded to our request and sent us the data). The ability to detect unpublished studies relies on the asymmetric distribution of effect sizes (see below). Such asymmetry is unlikely to be detected with smaller samples. We therefore set a minimum sample size of eight studies per metaanalysis (Sutton et al., 2000 a used a minimum of 10). This only removed one otherwise usable metaanalysis (Fernandez-Duque \& Valeggia, 1994). The meta-analyses we used are listed in Section VIII.},

  abstract = {Whether the effect of migration-selection-drift equilibrium on population structure is governed by spatial or environmental differences is usually elucidated by isolation-by-distance (IBD), isolation-by-environment (IBE), and isolation-by-resistance (IBR) tests. The population structure of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a broad-leaved evergreen psammophyte in eastern Central Asia, was previously thought to follow an isolation by distance pattern. However, recent studies have emphasized the effects of environmental factors on its growth and distribution, suggesting an important influence of local adaptation on the genetic structure of the species. Using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, we verified the previously inferred low intra-population variation and high inter-population differentiation. However, in contrast to previous studies, the results of partial Mantel tests and a maximum likelihood population effects mixed model (MLPE) suggested that local climate differences, rather than geographic distances or resistance distances, are the main factor affecting population differentiation. Further analysis with removal of multicollinear climatic variables and univariate MLPE found that summer and winter precipitation were crucial for shaping the current population genetic structure. Since local precipitation is related to the regeneration, colonization, and overwintering survival of A. mongolicus, its influence on demographic change may explain its effect on the population genetic structure. In addition, precipitation is related to terrain despite westward decreases, which explains the independence of genetic difference and geographic distance. The identified role of IBE suggests that collecting germplasm resources from genetically differentiated populations could be a more effective strategy to preserve the overall genetic diversity of the species than the establishment of corridors to enhance gene flow among populations.},

  abstract = {Roots of most terrestrial plants form symbiotic associations with fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are widespread and abundant. They are formed by bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms and are ubiquitous in most temperate and tropical ecosystems including agricultural systems. Ectomycorrhizas occur in certain families of woody gymnosperms and angiosperms and are extremely important in many temperate and boreal forests. The plant order Ericales contains a natural group of closely related families with worldwide distribution. Except for orchid and monotropoid associations, mycorrhizas involve plant exchange of photosynthates in return for a fungal exchange of mineral nutrients. The convergence of so many unrelated forms of mycorrhizas is a testament for the mutual benefits of these trading partnerships. Mycorrhizal interactions influence the species composition, diversity, and stability of biotic communities. Mycorrhizal fungi co-inhabit the rhizosphere with many saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi. One of the most important functions of mycorrhizas is their role in physically structuring soils. The total effect of roots and associated mycorrhizal fungi on soil structure is related to their turnover and decomposition rates. Aerts suggested that variation in access to different nutrient pools among various types of mycorrhizal fungi leads to positive feedback between the dominant plants in an ecosystem and litter decomposition. The average global temperature has risen since the early 1980s, and it has been predicted that the land surface temperature will increase by 3.1\textdegree{} C by 2085. The analytical challenge of holistic studies of complex interactions among communities of rhizosphere organisms and the environment is daunting. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This study provides evidence of range expansion under current climatic conditions of an indigenous species with strong ecosystem effects. Surveys of stands along the northern distribution limit of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in central Yukon Territory, Canada showed consistent increases in pine dominance following fire. These patterns differed strongly from those observed at sites where pine has been present for several thousand years. Differences in species thinning rates are unlikely to account for the observed increases in pine dominance. Rates of pine regeneration at its range limits were equivalent to those of spruce, indicating a capacity for rapid local population expansion. The study also found no evidence of strong climatic limitation of pine population growth at the northern distribution limit. We interpret these data as evidence of current pine expansion at its range limits and conclude that the northern distribution of lodgepole pine is not in equilibrium with current climate. This study has implications for our ability to predict vegetation response to climate change when populations may lag in their response to climate.},

Premises of statistical tests are often violated with such datasets because of the non-independence of residuals due to phylogenetic relationships or intraspecific population structure. If comparative approaches that account for the phylogenetic relationships of species are well developed and their benefits demonstrated, the importance of considering the intraspecific genetic structure, especially in combination with the phylogenetic structure, has rarely been addressed. We investigated whether it is beneficial to account for intraspecific genomic relatedness in multi-species studies. For this, we used a phylogenetic mixed model to analyse first a suite of simulated data and then results from one example ecological study\textemdash{}a budburst experiment where clippings of 10 tree and shrub species were subjected to different temperatures and photoperiods. We found that accounting for intraspecific genetic structure yields more accurate and precise fixed effects as well as increased statistical power, but more so when the relative importance of the intraspecific to the phylogenetic genetic structure is greater. Analysis of the budburst experiment further showed that accounting for intraspecific and phylogenetic structures yields improved estimates of warming and photoperiod effects and their interaction in explaining the time to budburst. Our results show that statistical gains can be made by incorporating information on the intraspecific genomic relatedness of individuals in multi-species studies. This is relevant to investigations that are interested in intraspecific variation and that plan to include such observations in statistical tests.},

State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broad- er-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation tech- niques, all under a single statistical framework.

Tree-ring characteristics were compared with monthly (1890\&\#8211;2001) and daily (1961\&\#8211;2001) climate data from an adjacent meteorological station. Chronologies for latewood (LW), earlywood (EW), and tree-ring widths (RW) were constructed from 73 living and dead trees. Correlation analyses show that tree growth is most sensitive to early summer precipitation. EW shows the strongest correlation with precipitation in May and June while LW is best correlated with June and July precipitation. A reconstruction model for May\&\#8211;June precipitation was calculated using principal component analysis (PCA) regression (regular regression) including EW, LW, and RW for present and previous years. The model explained 46\&\#037; of the variation in May\&\#8211;June precipitation and allowed a reconstruction back to 1560. Information about wet and dry years was collected from historical documents and was used to validate the result. Periods with precipitation above and below the mean show agreement with previous reconstructions of spring precipitation from tree rings in Finland and of spring floods from estuary sediments in the region. Analyses of correlations between meteorological stations and reconstructed precipitation show that the model is valid for the coastal part of central Sweden. The authors conclude that Scots pine trees on shingle fields are well suited for precipitation reconstruction, and the separate analyses of LW and EW improve the reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The subalpine environment of the Medicine Bow Mountains, Wyoming (USA) is characterized by frost events throughout the summer. As a result, growing season length is difficult to define in terms of frost-free days. For example, such a definition would have limited the 1993 growing season for many plants to only 5 days. The frequency of summertime frost events appeared particularly dependent on net losses of infrared energy to a cold night sky (radiation frost). These radiative losses to the night sky were strongly dependent on microsite sky exposure and leaf characteristics as well as meteorological conditions. During the summer of 1993, air temperatures at a height of 8 cm at the center of a subalpine meadow were below 0\textdegree{}C on 26 of 67 nights, while leaves of a broadleaf species (Erigeron peregrinus) frosted on 41 nights compared to 25 nights for a coniferous sapling (Abies lasiocarpa). In E. peregrinus, a strong association occurred between the frequency and duration of freezing episodes and the amount of sky exposure, with plants sheltered by forest canopy experiencing frost only 10\% to 40\% as often as those in the center of the meadow. At exposed locations, longwave radiation minima from the night sky were strongly correlated with the occurrence of leaf temperature minima. Thus, microsite sky exposure as well as the variation in longwave radiation from the atmosphere may have important implications for estimating growing season length and plant distribution patterns at higher elevations. Growth habit also influenced the occurrence of frost because plant height spanned a substantial vertical gradient in air temperature above the soil surface. This was particularly true on nights with low sky infrared radiation and low wind. On calm, clear nights, the coldest leaf temperatures (Tleaf{$\approx$} -11\textdegree{}C with Tair{$\approx$} -6\textdegree{}C) occurred because of the combined effects of low sky infrared radiation and low air temperature at plant heights. However, even on relatively windy nights with air temperature above freezing, net radiative losses to clear skies resulted in leaf frost. Flower temperatures of both E. peregrinus and Polygonum bistortoides tended to be significantly warmer ({$\approx$} 2\textdegree{}C) than leaf temperatures due to their greater height above the ground. Thus, leaf size, plant height, microsite exposure, and daily variation in sky infrared radiation all have important influences on the determination of frost frequency, duration, and intensity, as well as the length of the growing season. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

  abstract = {Stressors and heterogeneity are ubiquitous features of natural environments, and theory suggests that when environmental qualities alter flowering schedules through phenotypic plasticity, assortative mating can result that promotes evolutionary divergence. Therefore, it is important to determine whether common ecological stressors induce similar changes in flowering time. We review previous studies to determine whether two important stressors, water restriction and herbivory, induce consistent flowering time responses among species; for example, how often do water restriction and herbivory both delay flowering? We focus on the direction of change in flowering time, which affects the potential for divergence in heterogeneous environments. We also tested whether these stressors influenced time to flowering and nonphenology traits using Mimulus guttatus. The literature review suggests that water restriction has variable effects on flowering time, whereas herbivory delays flowering with exceptional consistency. In the Mimulus experiment, low water and herbivory advanced and delayed flowering, respectively. Overall, our results temper theoretical predictions for evolutionary divergence due to habitat-induced changes in flowering time; in particular, we discuss how accounting for variation in the direction of change in flowering time can either increase or decrease the potential for divergence. In addition, we caution against adaptive interpretations of stress-induced phenology shifts.},

As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations.},

Warming temperatures in the Mediterranean region are expected to exacerbate drought where they are not accompanied by increases in precipitation. We studied levels of annual growth in mature F. sylvatica trees over the last half-century in the Montseny Mountains in Catalonia (northeast Spain). Our results show significantly lower growth of mature trees at the lower limit of this species' distribution when compared with trees at higher altitudes. Growth at the lower Fagus limit is characterized by a rapid recent decline starting in approximately 1975. By 2003, growth of mature trees had fallen by 49\% when compared with predecline levels. This is not an age-related phenomenon, nor is it seen in comparable populations at higher altitudes. Analysis of climate-growth relationships suggests that the observed decline in growth is a result of warming temperatures and that, as precipitation in the region has not increased, precipitation is now insufficient to ameliorate the negative effects of increased temperatures on tree growth. As the climate-response of the studied forest is comparable with that of F. sylvatica forests in other southern European regions, it is possible that this growth decline is a more widespread phenomenon. Warming temperatures may lead to a rapid decline in the growth of range-edge populations and a consequent retreat of the species distribution in southern Europe. Assessment of long-term growth trends across the southern range edge of F. sylvatica therefore merits further attention.},

None of the landscape compo- nents\textemdash{}which included closed forest, deep valleys, open land and settlements\textemdash{}proved to be an impermeable barrier to gene flow by pollen. We found evidence that settlements, large open areas, and a pronounced topography increased long-distance gene flow in the landscape as compared to a random model including all possible gene flow trajectories. These results are encouraging from a conservation view, as gene flow in species pollinated by generalist insects seems to provide functional connectivity and may help to maintain genetic diversity in rare plant species in fragmented landscapes.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The model is based on simplifications to well-established three-dimensional Lagrangian stochastic approaches for turbulent scalar transport resulting in a two-parameterWald (or inverse Gaussian) distribution. Unlike commonly used phenomenological models, WALD's parameters can be estimated from the key factors affecting wind dispersal - wind statistics, seed release height, and seed terminal velocity - determined independently of dispersal data. WALD's asymptotic power-law tail has an exponent of -3/2, a limiting value verified by a meta-analysis for a wide variety of measured dispersal kernels and larger than the exponent of the bivariate Student t-test (2Dt). We tested WALD using three dispersal data sets on forest trees, heathland shrubs, and grassland forbs and compared WALD's performance with that of other analytical mechanistic models (revised versions of the tilted Gaussian Plume model and the advection-diffusion equation), revealing fairest agreement between WALD predictions and measurements. Analytical mechanistic models, such as WALD, combine the advantages of simplicity and mechanistic understanding and are valuable tools for modeling large-scale, long-term plant population dynamics.},

Adaptation to marginal habitats may be limited by genetic, developmental, and functional constraints, but also by consequences of demographic characteristics of marginal populations. Marginal populations are often sparse, fragmented, prone to local extinctions, or are demographic sinks subject to high immigration from high-quality core habitats. This makes them demographically and genetically dependent on core habitats and prone to gene flow counteracting local selection. Theoretical and empirical research in the past decade has advanced our understanding of conditions that favor adaptation to marginal habitats despite those limitations.

  abstract = {Aim Woody plant expansion and infilling in grasslands and savannas are occurring across a broad range of ecosystems around the globe and are commonly attributed to fire suppression, livestock grazing, nutrient enrichment and/or climate variability. In the western Great Plains, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) woodlands are expanding across broad geographical and environmental gradients. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the establishment of ponderosa pine in woodlands in the west-central Great Plains and to identify whether it was mediated by climate variability. Location Our study took place in a 400-km wide region from the base of the Front Range Mountains (c. 105 degrees W) to the central Great Plains (c. 100 degrees W) and from Nebraska (43 degrees N) to northern New Mexico (36 degrees N), USA. Methods Dates for establishment of ponderosa pine were reconstructed with tree rings in 11 woodland sites distributed across the longitudinal and latitudinal gradients of the study area. Temporal trends in decadal pine establishment were compared with summer Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Annual trends in pine establishment from 1985 to 2005 were compared with seasonal PDSI, temperature and moisture availability. Results Establishment of ponderosa pine occurred in the study area in all but one decade (1770s) between the 1750s and the early 2000s, with over 35\textbackslash\% of establishment in the region occurring after 1980. Pine establishment was highly variable among sites. Across the region, decadal pine establishment was persistently low from 1940 to 1960, when PDSI was below average. Annual pine establishment from 1985 to 2005 was positively correlated with summer PDSI and inversely correlated with minimum spring temperatures. Main conclusions Most ponderosa pine woodlands pre-date widespread Euro-American settlement of the region around c. ad 1860 and currently have stable tree populations. High variability in the timing of establishment of pine among sites highlights the multiplicity of factors that can drive woodland dynamics, including land use, fire history, CO2 enrichment, tree population dynamics and climate. Since the 1840s, the influence of climate was most notable across the study area during the mid-20th century, when the establishment of pine was suppressed by two significant droughts. The past sensitivity of establishment of ponderosa pine to drought suggests that woodland expansion will be negatively affected by predicted increases in temperature and drought in the Great Plains. \%Z \%+ \%\^},

There was a lack of population structure (F(ST) = 0.090) in the coastal portion of the species range, with estimates of population genetic diversity in microsatellite markers decreasing with latitude from California to British Columbia. A disjunct interior population in Idaho 450 km from the coastal range had the lowest diversity but the highest divergence of all populations studied. Only a single nucleotide polymorphism was discovered after sequencing 5547 base pairs in seven noncoding regions of cpDNA. Both cpDNA haplotypes were widely distributed throughout the species range. Quantitative variation among populations was moderate (0.11 {$\leq$} Q(ST) {$\leq$} 0.63), and weak but significant adaptive clines were found between quantitative traits and population climatic variables (0.09 {$\leq$} R(2) {$\leq$} 0.34). \textbullet{}Conclusions: Cornus nuttallii likely faced a population bottleneck in a single southern refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum.

  abstract = {Aim To evaluate whether seedlings of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) can establish beyond the species northern range limit in adjacent boreal forest. Location The hardwood-boreal forest transition zone on the north-east shore of Lake Superior, Ontario, Canada. Methods Seed fall of sugar maple was monitored for 5 years in a stand of this species at its northern range limit, and seed from this stand was transplanted to five micro-habitat types in an adjacent boreal forest. The establishment and survival of sugar maple seedlings there, and in the seed-source stand, was monitored for the following 7-11 years. Soil-surface light levels were measured in both forest types. Results Most seed fell in the final year of monitoring, when c. 250 seeds m(-2) were recorded. First-year seedling establishment rates in the maple stand, deriving from this mast seed year, was approximately double that deriving from seed transplanted to the boreal forest sites; this is tentatively attributed to seed predator satiation in the maple stand. However, subsequent seedling survivorship in the boreal forest was greater than that in the maple stand, resulting in comparable seedling densities by the end of 6 years. This difference is tentatively attributed to better illumination in the boreal forest sites, and canopy-opening disturbances appear to be especially facilitative of seedling survival. Main conclusions There is no fundamental impediment to sugar maple seedlings establishing in boreal forest communities if climate warming occurs and seed is available. If management intervention is needed to accelerate seed availability in a rapidly warming boreal forest, then diffuse seed application to disturbed boreal forest sites during mast years of local boreal tree species is recommended as the most effective way of avoiding seed predation and increasing seedling survival.},

Thus, there is a negative correlation between an individual's state at time 1 and the change in state from time 1 to time 2. In addition, whenever groups differ in their initial mean values, the expected change in the mean value from time 1 to time 2 will differ among the groups. For example, birds feeding nestlings lose weight, but initially heavier birds lose more weight than lighter birds, a result expected from the regression effect. In sexual selection, males who remain unmated in the first year are, on average, less attractive than mated males. The regression effect predicts that these males will increase their attractiveness in the second year more than mated males. In well-designed experiments, changes in the experimental and control groups would be compared. In observational studies, however, no such comparison is available, and expected differential effects must be accounted for before they can be attributed to external causes. We describe methods to correct for the regression effect and assess alternative causal explanations.},

Tree-ring width of P. edulis and other semiarid tree species is most frequently related to annual precipitation amount alone or to the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). But water deficit and associated variation in moisture can also be described using numerous other indices such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and a comparison of the performance of several indices that relate historical climate data to tree-ring variation in P. edulis is lacking. We compared abilities to predict radial tree-ring growth of P. edulis using five metrics of water availability: PDSI, two indices based on precipitation alone (total precipitation and SPI), and two indices that factor in temperature to determine water deficit (based on Walter climate diagrams that use monthly precipitation and temperature). Each metric was evaluated over three commonly used time periods (water year, calendar year, and June-August) using the limited available data from P. edulis sites in the southwestern USA where co-located tree-ring and weather data were available. Our results indicate that PDSI was the best predictor of P. edulis ring widths, regardless of time period, and provide a first comparative test of PDSI with SPI and Walter indices that can be further tested as larger data sets become available. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

As these countries urbanized, romantic and symbolic forest values increased. Today the social values of forest recreation, landscapes and non-game wildlife are of increased importance. These forest social values are usually expressed by social and political systems. Since utilitarian social values are often in conflict with romantic/symbolic forest values today, foresters increasingly are placed in the role of conflict managers. In what they do, and do not do, foresters can dampen or exacerbate forestry social conflict. \textcopyright{} 1985.},

Assessments should also include the context of other ongoing changes, such as globalisation, that will impact communities and exacerbate their vulnerabilities. This paper presents an assessment of vulnerability and adaptive capacity in the forestry sector in the Pite River basin in northern Sweden. The study was carried out using a multi-method design encompassing literature surveys, interviews with stakeholders, and stakeholder meetings. The paper concludes that while climate change will have an impact on the region, its effect will be superseded by that of broader socio-economic changes.

Climate variables studied included temperature, precipitation and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) drought index. Landsat data analysis showed that stand mortality was first detected in the year 2006 at an elevation of 650m, and extended up to 900m by the year 2012. Mortality was accompanied by a decrease in MODIS-derived vegetation index (EVI). The area of dead stands and the upper mortality line were correlated with increased drought. The uphill margin of mortality was limited by elevational precipitation gradients. Dead stands (i.e., {$>$}75\% tree mortality) were located mainly on southern slopes. With respect to slope, mortality was observed within a 7\textendash{}20\textdegree{} range with greatest mortality occurring on convex terrain. Tree radial increment measurements correlate and were synchronous with SPEI (r2=0.37, rs=80). The results also showed the primary role of drought stress on Siberian pine mortality. A secondary role may be played by bark beetles and root fungi attacks. The observed Siberian pine mortality is part of a broader phenomenon of ``dark needle conifers'' (DNC, i.e., Siberian pine, fir and spruce) decline and mortality in European Russia, Siberia, and the Russian Far East. All locations of DNC decline coincided with areas of observed drought increase. The results obtained are one of the first observations of drought-induced decline and mortality of DNC at the southern border of boreal forests. Meanwhile if model projections of increased aridity are correct DNC within the southern part of its areal may be replaced by drought-resistant Pinus silvestris and Larix sibirica.},

We study the probability that mutations become established in changing environments by extending the classic theory for branching processes. When environments change in time, under quite general conditions, the establishment probability is approximately twice the 'effective selection coefficient', whose value is an average that gives most weight to a mutant's fitness in the generations immediately after it appears. When fitness varies along a gradient in a continuous habitat, increased dispersal generally decreases the chance a mutation establishes because mutations move out of areas where they are most adapted. When there is a patch of favourable habitat that moves in time, there is a maximum speed of movement above which mutations cannot become established, regardless of when and where they first appear. This critical speed limit, which is proportional to the mutation's maximum selective advantage, represents an absolute constraint on the potential of locally adapted mutations to contribute to evolutionary rescue.},

  abstract = {Climate change has many potential effects on plants, some detrimental to growth, others beneficial. Increasing CO2 concentration can increase photosynthetic rates, with the greatest increases likely to be in Cg plants growing in warm dry conditions. Increasing temperature directly affects plant growth through effects on photosynthetic and respiration rates. However, plants have a considerable ability to adapt to changing conditions and can tolerate extremely high temperatures, provided that adequate water is available. Increasing temperature may increase vapor pressure deficits of the air, and thereby increase transpiration rates from most plant canopies. Effects are likely to vary among plant communities, with forests generally experiencing greater increases in transpiration rates than,grasslands. These increases in transpiration are likely to be reduced by stomatal closure in response to increasing CO2 concentration. In many areas, precipitation will probably increase with global warming; however, these increases may be insufficient to meet the increased transpirational demand by plant canopies. Increasing temperature is likely to increase soil organic matter decomposition rates so that nutrients may be more readily mineralized and made available to plants. In highly fertile systems, this could lead to nutrient losses through leaching. For different combinations of increases in temperature and CO2 concentration, and for systems primarily affected by water or nutrient limitations, different overall effects on plant productivity can be expected. Responses will be negative in some circumstances and positive in others, but on the whole, catastrophic changes to forest growth seem unlikely under most conditions. In contrast, ecological consequences of climate change are potentially more serious. The distribution of many species tends to be limited to a narrow range of environmental conditions. Climate conditions over much of a species' current natural range may therefore become unsuitable, leading to significant decline of forests or of particular species within forests.},

  abstract = {Evidence of an atmospheric CO2 fertilization effect on radial growth rates was uncovered by examining climate-growth relationships for seven western juniper tree-ring chronologies in central Oregon using multiple regression models. Consistent upward trends of the residuals from dendroclimatic models indicated a decreased ability for climate parameters to predict growth with time. Additionally, an assessment was made of whether enhanced growth was detectable under drought conditions, because a major benefit of elevated atmospheric CO2 is the reduction of water stress. Mean ring indices were compared between ecologically comparable drought years, when atmospheric CO2 was lower (1896-1949), and more recent drought years that occurred under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations (1950-96/98). The results presented herein show that: (i) residuals from climate/growth models had a significant positive trend at six of seven sites, suggesting the presence of a nonclimatic factor causing increased growth during recent decades; (ii) overall growth was 23\% greater in the latter half of the 20th century; (iii) growth indices during matched drought and matched wet years were 63\% and 30\% greater, respectively, in the later 20th century than the earlier 20th century; and (iv) harsher sites had greater responses during drought periods between early and late periods. While it is not possible to rule out other factors, these results are consistent with expectations for CO2 fertilization effects.},

The height to which trees can grow and the biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict heights of up to 120 m in the absence of mechanical damage, but there are historical accounts of taller trees. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7 m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122-130 m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Acost or resistance surface is a representation of a landscape's permeability to animal movement or gene flow and is a tool formeasuring functional connectivity in landscape ecology and genetics studies. Parameterizing cost surfaces by assigning weights to different landscape elements has been challenging however, because true costs are rarely known; thus, expert opinion is often used to derive relative weights. Assigning weights would be made easier if the sensitivity of different landscape resistance estimates to relative costs was known.We carried out a sensitivity analysis of three methods to param- eterize a cost surface and two models of landscape permeability: least cost path and effective resistance. We found two qualitatively different responses to varying cost weights: linear and asymptotic changes. The most sensitive models (i.e. those leading to linear change) were accumulated least cost and effective resistance estimates on a surface coded as resis- tance (i.e. where high-quality elements were held constant at a low-value, and low-quality elements were varied at higher values). All other cost surface scenarios led to asymptotic change.Developing a cost surface that produces a linear response of landscape resistance estimates to cost weight variation will improve the accuracy of functional connectivity estimates, especially when cost weights are selected through statistical model fitting procedures.On the other hand, for studieswhere cost weights are unknown andmodel selection is not being used, methods where resistance estimates vary asymptotically with cost weightsmay be more appropriate, because of their relative insensitivity to parameterization},

This question is difficult to answer scientifically, as we are dealing with an n=1 10 scenario: every individual who has ever written about evolution is a human being. I discuss patterns 11 such as taxonomic chauvinism, i.e. less attention being paid to species that differ more from human-12 like life histories. Textbooks on evolution reinforce such biases insofar as they present, as a default 13 case, systems that resemble ours in terms of life cycles and other features (e.g. gonochorism). 14 Additionally, societal norms may have led to incorrect null hypotheses such as females not mating 15 multiply. The human tendency to understand general biological phenomena via 'putting oneself in 16 another organism's shoes' has upsides and downsides. As an upside, our intuitive ability to rethink 17 strategies if the situation changes can lead to ready generation of adaptive hypotheses. Downsides 18 occur if we trust this intuition too much, and particular danger zones exist for traits where humans 19 are an unusual species. I argue that the levels of selection debate might have proceeded differently if 20 human cooperation patterns were not so unique, as this brings about unique challenges in biology 21 teaching; and that theoretical insights regarding inbreeding avoidance vs. tolerance could have 22 spread faster if we were not extrapolating our emotional reactions to incest disproportionately 23 depending on whether we study animals or plants.},

Invasions of new territory-by plants, animals, or genes-are an old topic in ecology, but hardly obsolete: the spread of pests such as the gypsy moth, plants, recurrent and emerging infectious diseases, and genetically engi organisms are important contemporary problems for ecology.

In this paper, we are given the tools to to study the rate of spread for invading organisms in a very different kind of integrodifference equations. Unlike diffusion equations, these models can accom-stimulate research modate leptokurtic (broad-tailed) dispersal patterns, and in such cases they can exhibit the accelerating rates of spread that have been observed in some invasions. in ecology Of course this does not mean that we should stop using diffusion models, bu gives us an alternative with a different set of assumptions that is likely to be more accurate when the dispersal pattern of individuals is far from the Gaussian dis-tribution implicit in a diffusion model. Abstract Models that describe the spread of invading organisms often assume that the dispersal distances of propagules are normally distributed. In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading popu-lation is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat-tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant-speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction-diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial thresh-I Manuscript old in order to invade successfully. Fat-tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions.},

Many mathematical models of biological invasions use nonlinear integrodifference equations to describe the growth and dispersal processes and to predict the speed of invasion fronts. Linear models have received less attention, perhaps because they are difficult to simulate for large times. In this paper, we use the saddle-point method, alias the method of steepest descent, to derive asymptotic approximations for the solutions of linear integrodifference equations. We work through five examples, for Gaussian, Laplace, and uniform dispersal kernels in one dimension and for asymmetric Gaussian and radially symmetric Laplace kernels in two dimensions. Our approximations are extremely close to the exact solutions, even for intermediate times. We also employ an empirical saddle-point approximation to pre-dict densities using dispersal data. We use our approximations to examine the effects of censored dispersal data on estimates of invasion speed and population density.},

Slowly increasing stresses may induce physiological adjustment that protects plants from the growth inhibition and/or injury that follow when environmental stresses are abruptly imposed. In addition, short exposures of woody plants to extreme environmental conditions at critical times in their development often improve growth. Furthermore, maintaining harvested seedlings and plant products at very low temperatures extends their longevity. Drought tolerance: Seedlings previously exposed to water stress often undergo less inhibition of growth and other processes following transplanting than do seedlings not previously exposed to such stress. Controlled wetting and drying cycles often promote early budset, dormancy, and drought tolerance. In many species increased drought tolerance following such cycles is associated with osmotic adjustment that involves accumulation of osmotically active substances, Maintenance of leaf turgor often is linked to osmotic adjustment. A reduction in osmotic volume at full turgor also results in reduced osmotic potential, even in the absence of solute accumulation. Changes in tissue elasticity may be important for turgor maintenance and drought tolerance of plants that do not adjust osmotically. Water deficits and nutrient deficiencies promote greater relative allocation of photosynthate to root growth, ultimately resulting in plants that have higher root:shoot ratios and greater capacity to absorb water and minerals relative to the shoots that must be supported. At the molecular level, plants respond to water stress by synthesis of certain new proteins and increased levels of synthesis of some proteins produced under well-watered conditions. Evidence has been obtained for enhanced synthesis under water stress of water-channel proteins and other proteins that may protect membranes and other important macromolecules from damage and denaturation as cells dehydrate. Flood tolerance: Both artificial and natural flooding sometimes benefit woody plants. Flooding of orchard soils has been an essential management practice for centuries to increase fruit yields and improve fruit quality. Also, annual advances and recessions of floods are crucial for maintaining valuable riparian forests. Intermittent flooding protects bottomland forests by increasing groundwater supplies, transporting sediments necessary for creating favorable seedbeds, and regulating decomposition of organic matter. Major adaptations for flood tolerance of some woody plants include high capacity for producing adventitious roots that compensate physiologically for decay of original roots under soil anaerobiosis, facilitation of oxygen up-take through stomata and newly formed lenticels, and metabolic adjustments. Halophytes can adapt to saline water by salt tolerance, salt avoidance, or both. Cold hardiness: Environmental stresses that inhibit plant growth, including low temperature, drought, short days, and combinations of these, induce cold hardening and hardiness in many species. Cold hardiness develops in two stages: at temperatures between 10degrees and 20degreesC in the autumn, when carbohydrates and lipids accumulate; and at subsequent freezing temperatures. The sum of many biochemical processes determines the degree of cold tolerance. Some of these processes are hormone dependent and induced by short days; others that are linked to activity of enzyme systems are temperature dependent. Short days are important for development of cold hardiness in species that set buds or respond strongly to photoperiod. Nursery managers often expose tree seedlings to moderate water stress at or near the end of die growing season. This accelerates budset, induces early dormancy, and increases cold hardiness. Pollution tolerance: Absorption of gaseous air pollutants varies with resistance to flow along the pollutant's diffusion path. Hence, the amount of pollutant absorbed by leaves depends on stomatal aperture, stomatal size, and stomatal frequency. Pollution tolerance is increased when drought, dry air, or flooding of soil close stomatal pores. Heat tolerance: Exposure to sublethal high temperature can increase the thermotolerance of plants. Potential mechanisms of response include synthesis of heat-shock proteins and isoprene and antioxidant production to protect the photosynthetic apparatus and cellular metabolism. Breaking of dormancy: Seed dormancy can be broken by cold or heat. Embryo dormancy is broken by prolonged exposure of most seeds to temperatures of 1degrees to 15degreesC. The efficiency of treatment depends on interactions between temperature and seed moisture content. Germination can be postponed by partially dehydrating seeds or altering the temperature during seed stratification. Seed-coat dormancy can be broken by fires that rupture seed coats or melt seed-coat waxes, hence promoting water uptake. Seeds with both embryo dormancy and seed-coat dormancy may require exposure to both high and low temperatures to break dormancy. Exposure to smoke itself can also serve as a germination cue in breaking seed dormancy in some species. Bud dormancy of temperate-zone trees is broken by winter cold. The specific chilling requirement varies widely with species and genotype, type of bud (e.g., vegetative or floral bud), depth of dormancy, temperature, duration of chilling, stage of plant development, and daylength, Interruption of a cold regime by high temperature may negate the effect of sustained chilling or breaking of bud dormancy. Near-lethal heat stress may release buds from both endodormancy and ecodormancy. Pollen shedding: Dehiscence of anthers and release of pollen result from dehydration of walls of anther sacs. Both seasonal and diurnal pollen shedding are commonly associated with shrinkage and rupture of anther walls by low relative humidity. Pollen shedding typically is maximal near midday (low relative humidity) and low at night (high relative humidity). Pollen shedding is low or negligible during rainy periods. Seed dispersal: Gymnosperm cones typically dehydrate before opening. The cones open and shed seeds because of differential shrinkage between the adaxial and abaxial tissues of cone scales. Once opened, cones may close and reopen with changes in relative humidity. Both dehydration and heat are necessary for seed dispersal from serotinous (late-to-open) cones. Seeds are stored in serotinous cones because resinous bonds of scales prevent cone opening. After fire melts the resinous material, the cone scales can open on drying. Fires also stimulate germination of seeds of some species. Some heath plants require fire to open their serotinous follicles and shed seeds. Fire destroys the resin at the valves of follicles, and the valves then reflex to release the seeds. Following fire the follicles of some species require alternate wetting and drying for efficient seed dispersal. Stimulation of reproductive growth., Vegetative and reproductive growth of woody plants are negatively correlated. A heavy crop of fruits, cones, and seeds is associated with reduced vegetative growth in the same or following year (or even years). Subjecting trees to drought during early stages of fruit development to inhibit vegetative growth, followed by normal irrigation, sometimes favors reproductive growth. Short periods of drought at critical times not only induce formation of flower buds but also break dormancy of flower buds in some species. Water deficits may induce flowering directly or by inhibiting shoot flushing, thereby limiting the capacity of young leaves to inhibit floral induction. Postharvest water stress often results in abundant return bloom over that in well-irrigated plants. Fruit yields of some species are not reduced or are increased by withholding irrigation during the period of shoot elongation. In several species, osmotic adjustment occurs during deficit irrigation. In other species, increased fruit growth by imposed drought is not associated largely with osmotic adjustment and maintenance of leaf turgor. Seedling storage: Tree seedlings typically are stored at temperatures just above or below freezing. Growth and survival of cold-stored seedlings depend on such factors as: date of lifting from the nursery; species and genotype; storage temperature, humidity, and illumination; duration of storage; and handling of planting stock after storage. Seedlings to be stored over winter should be lifted from the nursery as late as possible. Dehydration of seedlings before, during, and after storage adversely affects growth of outplanted seedlings. Long-term storage of seedlings may result in depletion of stored carbohydrates by respiration and decrease of root growth potential. Although many seedlings are stored in darkness, a daily photoperiod during cold storage may stimulate subsequent growth and increase survival of outplanted seedlings. For some species, rapid thawing may decrease respiratory consumption of carbohydrates (over slowly thawed seedlings) and decrease development of molds. Pollen storage: Preservation of pollen is necessary for insurance against poor flowering years, for gene conservation, and for physiological and biochemical studies. Storage temperature and pollen moisture content largely determine longevity of stored pollen. Pollen can be stored successfully for many years in deep freezers at temperatures near -15degreesC or in liquid nitrogen (-196degreesC). Cryopreservation of pollen with a high moisture content is difficult because ice crystals may destroy the cells. Pollens of many species do not survive at temperatures below -40degreesC if their moisture contents exceed 20-30\%. Pollen generally is air dried, vacuum dried, or freeze dried before it is stored. To preserve the germination capacity of stored pollen, rehydration at high humidity often},

We used two parameters (\texttheta{}(B) and \texttheta{}(W)) scaling the contributions of inter- and intrapopulation allelic covariation between genes controlling the trait of interest. We monitored the changes in \texttheta{}(B) and \texttheta{}(W), Q(ST) and G(STq) over successive generations of divergent and stabilizing selection, in simulations for an outcrossing species with extensive gene flow. The dynamics of these parameters are characterized by two phases. Initially, during the earliest generations, differentiation of the trait increases very rapidly and the principal and immediate driver of Q(ST) is \texttheta{}(B). During subsequent generations, G(STq) increases steadily and makes an equal contribution to Q(ST). These results show that selection first captures beneficial allelic associations at different loci at different populations, and then targets changes in allelic frequencies. The same patterns are observed when environmental change modifies divergent selection, as shown by the very rapid response of \texttheta{}(B) to the changes of selection regimes. We compare our results with previous experimental findings and consider their relevance to the detection of molecular signatures of natural selection.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012) ABSTRACT: Forest trees are the dominant species in many parts of the world and predicting how they might respond to climate change is a vital global concern. Trees are capable of long-distance gene flow, which can promote adaptive evolution in novel environments by increasing genetic variation for fitness. It is unclear, however, if this can compensate for maladaptive effects of gene flow and for the long-generation times of trees. We critically review data on the extent of long-distance gene flow and summarise theory that allows us to predict evolutionary responses of trees to climate change. Estimates of long-distance gene flow based both on direct observations and on genetic methods provide evidence that genes can move over spatial scales larger than habitat shifts predicted under climate change within one generation. Both theoretical and empirical data suggest that the positive effects of gene flow on adaptation may dominate in many instances. The balance of positive to negative consequences of gene flow may, however, differ for leading edge, core and rear sections of forest distributions. We propose future experimental and theoretical research that would better integrate dispersal biology with evolutionary quantitative genetics and improve predictions of tree responses to climate change.},

  abstract = {Although generations of researchers have studied the factors that limit the distributions of species, we still do not seem to understand this phenomenon comprehensively. Traditionally, species' ranges have been seen as the consequence of abiotic conditions and local adaptation to the environment. However, during the last years it has become more and more evident that biotic factors \textendash{} such as intra- and interspecific interactions or the dispersal capacity of species \textendash{} and even rapidly occurring evolutionary processes can strongly influence the range of a species and its potential to spread to new habitats. Relevant eco-evolutionary forces can be found at all hierarchical levels: from landscapes to communities via populations, individuals and genes. We here use the metapopulation concept to develop a framework that allows us to synthesize this broad spectrum of different factors. Since species' ranges are the result of a dynamic equilibrium of colonization and local extinction events, the importance of dispersal is immediately clear. We highlight the complex interrelations and feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary forces that shape dispersal and result in non-trivial and partially counter-intuitive range dynamics. Our concept synthesizes current knowledge on range biology and the eco-evolutionary dynamics of dispersal.},

Molecular phenology is defined here as the study of the seasonal patterns of organisms captured by molecular biology techniques. The history of molecular phenology is reviewed briefly in relation to advances in the quantification technology of gene expression. High-resolution molecular phenology (HMP) data have enabled us to study phenology with an approach of in natura systems biology. I review recent analyses of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a temperature-responsive repressor of flowering, along the six steps in the typical flow of in natura systems biology. The extensive studies of the regulation of FLC have made this example a successful case in which a comprehensive understanding of gene functions has been progressing. The FLC-mediated long-term memory of past temperatures creates time lags with other seasonal signals, such as photoperiod and short-term temperature. Major signals that control flowering time have a phase lag between them under natural conditions, and hypothetical phase lag calendars are proposed as mechanisms of season detection in plants. Transcriptomic HMP brings a novel strategy to the study of molecular phenology, because it provides a comprehensive representation of plant functions. I discuss future perspectives of molecular phenology from the standpoints of molecular biology, evolutionary biology and ecology.},

  abstract = {Dispersal of airborne spores, pollen and seeds is important for various ecological and biological processes, and therefore modeling tools are needed in order to predict the dispersal patterns of these particles. In this study, we use a Lagrangian stochastic (LS) modeling approach to describe airborne particles dispersal in the atmospheric boundary layer. The LS dispersal model is extended to include non-Gaussian turbulence in the upper parts of the atmospheric boundary layer, as well as the reduction of the autocorrelation time in trajectories due to the high terminal velocity of particles. The sensitivity of particle dispersal on biological and atmospheric factors is assessed by simulating dispersal patterns under varying environmental conditions. Similarly, the level of needed model complexity for describing the particle dispersal is examined. Our particle dispersal simulations suggest that the level of model complexity and accuracy needed in the description of biological and atmospheric factors depends on the particle size and the distance and time-scale over which the particle dispersal is monitored. More simplification is justified for light particles, whereas heavy particles require more accuracy in modeling. For example, we found out that the local dispersal of light particles is hardly affected by the atmospheric stability whereas it has a strong effect on the dispersal of heavy particles. Based on our simulations, we developed guidelines for modeling airborne particle dispersal. Together with the detailed description of the LS dispersion model and its parameterization throughout the atmospheric boundary layer, these can serve as basis for various particle dispersal studies and help ecologists and biologists not so familiar with meteorological modeling tools to apply the LS model for spore, pollen and seed dispersal. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Genotypes are characterized by the combination of two alleles at a bi-parentally inherited locus that may affect any demographic process. We use AMELIE to study how transgene spread from a genetically modified (GM) to a conventional forest depends on the demographic trait modified by the transgene, on transgene expression, and on the initial genotype of GM plants. Transgene spread strongly depends on the interplay between trait modification and transgene expression, which jointly define the ability of heterozygous plants to replace conventional ones. When examining two alternative measures for controlling transgene spread, we find that planting heterozygous GM plants initially reduces transgene spread, whereas transgene recessiveness has more long-term effects on gene flow. The results of this study thus have direct implications for the assessment and management of GM risks. The flexible framework for modelling population-genotype dynamics furthermore has various applications in conservation biology. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of genetically modified (GM) plants has raised concerns about the escape of transgenes to conventional populations. To counteract possible fitness advantages of GM plants, an advantageous 'primary transgene' may be linked to a 'mitigation' transgene that is selectively disfavored. A risk related to this technique is the possible break-up of the transgenes. This may lead to the establishment of genotypes that only express the primary transgenic trait and are therefore selectively favored over both conventional and GM genotypes. We study here how the establishment of break-up genotypes in tree populations depends on life history, pollen dispersal kernels, and the linkage between transgenes. To this end, we model the dynamics of an initially homozygous GM population and a conventional population growing next to each other. The simulations are based on a spatially explicit simulation model for population-genotype dynamics. Pollen and seed dispersal are described by fat-tailed dispersal kernels. Break-up of transgenes is due subsequent crossing of GM and conventional genotypes. The spatial pattern of pollen and seed dispersal causes break-up and establishment of new invasive genotypes to occur mostly in the conventional population. The amount of individuals of these genotypes established in the conventional population depends on the interaction between life-history traits, pollen dispersal distances and the linkage of the transgenes. Thus, risk assessment of transgene break-up requires information on the genetics, local dynamics, and dispersal of GM and conventional varieties. The approach presented here provides a tool for combining these different sources of information, and it contributes to the formulation of general rules for the management of GM tree populations.},

Quantifying LDD is thus important for predicting the future dynamics of plants exposed to environmental changes. However, environmental changes can also alter the behaviour of LDD vectors: for instance, increasing air temperature may enhance atmospheric instability, thereby altering the turbulent airflow that transports seed and pollen. Here, we investigate temperature effects on wind dispersal in a boreal forest using a 10-year time series of micrometeorological measurements and a Lagrangian stochastic model for particle transport. For a wide range of dispersal and life history types, we found positive relations between air temperature and LDD. This translates into a largely consistent positive effect of +3 degrees C warming on predicted LDD frequencies and spread rates of plants. Relative increases in LDD frequency tend to be higher for heavy-seeded plants, whereas absolute increases in LDD and spread rates are higher for light-seeded plants for which wind is often an important dispersal vector. While these predicted increases are not sufficient to compensate forecasted range losses and environmental changes can alter plant spread in various ways, our results generally suggest that warming can promote wind-driven movements of plant genotypes and populations in boreal forests.},

  abstract = {Forecasts of rapid climate change raise the question how quickly species can evolutionarily adapt to future climates. The adaptability of forest trees to environmental changes is generally promoted by high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow, but it can also be slowed down by long generation times and low mortality of established trees. Here, we investigate the adaptation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Silver birch (Betula pendula) to climate change induced prolongation of the thermal growing season. We use quantitative genetic individual-based simulations to disentangle the relative roles of mortality, dispersal ability and maturation age for the speed of adaptation. The simulations predict that after 100 years of climate change, the genotypic growth period length of both species will lag more than 50\% behind the climatically determined optimum. This lag is reduced by increased mortality of established trees, whereas earlier maturation and higher dispersal ability had comparatively minor effects. The evolutionary lag behind environmental change shown in our simulations stresses the importance of accounting for evolutionary processes in forecasts of the future dynamics and productivity of forests. Sensitivity of the adaptation speed to mortality suggests that species experiencing high mortality rates as well as populations subject to regular disturbances such as storms or fires might be the quickest to adapt to a warming climate. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large-scale outbreaks. During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000-2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to approximately 75\% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959-1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.},

  abstract = {The fungi disperse spores to move across landscapes and spore liberation takes different patterns. While many species release spores intermittently, others release spores at specific times of day or night according to intrinsic rhythms. Despite intriguing evidence of diurnal rhythms, why the timing of spore liberation would matter to a fungus remains an open question. Here we use state-of-the-art numerical simulations of atmospheric transport with meteorological data to follow the trajectory of many spores released in the open atmosphere at different times of day, during different seasons and at different locations across North America. While individual spores follow unpredictable trajectories due to turbulence, in the aggregate patterns emerge: statistically, spores released during the day fly for several days, while spores released at night return to the ground within a few hours. Differences are caused by intense turbulence during the day and weak turbulence at night. The pattern is widespread but its reliability varies, for example, day/night patterns are stronger in southern regions, where temperatures are warmer. Results provide a set of testable hypotheses explaining intermittent and regular patterns of spore release as strategies to maximize spore survival in the air. Species with short lived spores reproducing where there is strong and regular turbulence during the day, for example in Mexico, will maximize survival by routinely releasing spores at night. Where cycles are weak, for example in Canada during spring, there will be no benefit to releasing spores at the same time every day. We also challenge the perception of atmospheric dispersal as risky, wasteful, and beyond control of a sporocarp; our data suggest the timing of spore liberation may be finely tuned by a fungus to maximize fitness during atmospheric transport.},

Yet only few of them are considering the succession of mating and dispersal. The sequence of these events influences gene flow and consequently affects the dynamics and evolution of populations. We use individual- based simulations to investigate the evolution of the timing of dispersal and mating, i.e. mating before or after dispersal. We assume a discrete insect metapopulation in a heterogeneous environment, where populations may adapt to local con- ditions and only females are allowed to disperse. We run the model assuming different levels of species habitat tolerance, carrying capacity, and temporal environmental variability. Our results show that in species with narrow habitat tolerance, low to moderate dispersal evolves in combination with mating after dispersal (post-dispersal mating). With such a strategy dispersing females benefit from mating with a resident male, as their offspring will be better adapted to the local habitat conditions. On the contrary, in species with wide habitat tolerance higher dispersal rates in combination with pre-dispersal mating evolves. In this case individuals are adapted to the `average' habitat where pre-dispersal mating conveys the benefit of carrying relatives' genes into a new population. With high dispersal rates and large population size, local adaptation and kin structure both vanish and the temporal sequence of dispersal and mating may become a (nearly) neutral trait.},

However the data on how gene-flow changes following habitat fragmentation is contradictory. If there is significant gene-flow between spatially isolated populations then limited conservation resources could be directed away from projects to 'establish genetic connectivity' and used to address other consequences of habitat fragmentation.This research focused on an endangered tree species Gomortega keule (Gomortegaceae) in a fragmented landscape in the Central Chile Biodiversity Hotspot and addressed three questions: (1) How far does pollen move between pollen donors and seed trees and what is the shape of the dispersal curve? (2) Do insect pollinators travel outside of forest patches? (3) Do small populations and single trees contribute to genetic connectivity across the landscape?Paternity analysis results show that G. keule's insect pollinators travel outside of forest patches, over distances of 6. km, beyond the scale of population fragmentation or genetic structure. Pollen moved from small sites and single trees into large sites, as well as in the other direction, indicating these sites play a key role as functioning elements of the wider population and as stepping stones between sites. Fragmentation at the scale investigated has not led to genetic isolation, thus genetic connectivity per se is not a conservation priority. Other consequences of land-use change, specifically continuing habitat loss and population reduction, still threaten the survival of the species. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Selected, predominantly American, women ecologists are presented within five time frames according to the date of their PhD, an event marking the beginning of their careers. A general view is given for pre-1900 Protoecologists, followed by brief professional sketches for 10 Early Pioneers (1900-1934), 16 Late Pioneers (1935-1960), and 28 members of the First Modern Wave (1961-1975). The relatively large number of women who earned doctorates after 1975 precludes discussion of individuals from this time in this review. The following issues are discussed in the context of their research contributions: 1) motivating factors, 2) graduate education and subfield entered, 3) mentors and role models, 4) employment, 5) marriage and family constraints, and 6) recognition. These issues are compared with data from recent surveys for post-1976 women doctorates. Each selected woman still alive was contacted for her assessment of her research; 156 research citations display the significance and range of subjects studied. A steady, albeit slow, progress since 1900 is evident, although some problems regarding gender equality in professional development of women ecologists persist. These issues, however, are now more clearly recognized and addressed.},

Most landscape genetics studies have focused on patterns of gene flow at a regional scale. However, the genetic structure of populations at a local scale may be influenced by a unique suite of landscape variables that have little bearing on connectivity patterns observed at broader spatial scales. We investigated fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic variation and gene flow in relation to features of the landscape in desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), using 859 tortoises genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci with associated data on geographic location, sex, elevation, slope, and soil type, and spatial relationship to putative barriers (power lines, roads). We used spatially explicit and non-explicit Bayesian clustering algorithms to partition the sample into discrete clusters, and characterize the relationships between genetic distance and ecological variables to identify factors with the greatest influence on gene flow at a local scale. Desert tortoises exhibit weak genetic structure at a local scale, and we identified two subpopulations across the study area. Although genetic differentiation between the subpopulations was low, our landscape genetic analysis identified both natural (slope) and anthropogenic (roads) landscape variables that have significantly influenced gene flow within this local population. We show that desert tortoise movements at a local scale are influenced by features of the landscape, and that these features are different than those that influence gene flow at larger scales. Our findings are important for desert tortoise conservation and management, particularly in light of recent translocation efforts in the region. More generally, our results indicate that recent landscape changes can affect gene flow at a local scale and that their effects can be detected almost immediately.},

  abstract = {Predicted changes in the global climate are likely to cause large shifts in the geographic ranges of many plant and animal species. To date, predictions of future range shifts have relied on a variety of modeling approaches with different levels of model accuracy. Using a common data set, we investigated the potential implications of alternative modeling approaches for conclusions about future range shifts and extinctions. Our common data set entailed the current ranges of 100 randomly selected mammal species found in the western hemisphere. Using these range maps, we compared six methods for modeling predicted future ranges. Predicted future distributions differed markedly across the alternative modeling approaches, which in turn resulted in estimates of extinction rates that ranged between 0\% and 7\%, depending on which model was used. Random forest predictors, a model-averaging approach, consistently outperformed the other techniques (correctly predicting 499\% of current absences and 86\% of current presences). We conclude that the types of models used in a study can have dramatic effects on predicted range shifts and extinction rates; and that model-averaging approaches appear to have the greatest potential for predicting range shifts in the face of climate change.},

  abstract = {Plant responses to the projected future levels of CO(2) were first characterized in short-term experiments lasting days to weeks. However, longer term acclimation responses to elevated CO(2) were subsequently discovered to be very important in determining plant and ecosystem function. Free-Air CO(2) Enrichment (FACE) experiments are the culmination of efforts to assess the impact of elevated CO(2) on plants over multiple seasons and, in the case of crops, over their entire lifetime. FACE has been used to expose vegetation to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) under completely open-air conditions for nearly two decades. This review describes some of the lessons learned from the long-term investment in these experiments. First, elevated CO(2) stimulates photosynthetic carbon gain and net primary production over the long term despite down-regulation of Rubisco activity. Second, elevated CO(2) improves nitrogen use efficiency and, third, decreases water use at both the leaf and canopy scale. Fourth, elevated CO(2) stimulates dark respiration via a transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism. Fifth, elevated CO(2) does not directly stimulate C(4) photosynthesis, but can indirectly stimulate carbon gain in times and places of drought. Finally, the stimulation of yield by elevated CO(2) in crop species is much smaller than expected. While many of these lessons have been most clearly demonstrated in crop systems, all of the lessons have important implications for natural systems.},

Both years were characterized by different spatial patterns of drought (expressed through rainfall and Palmer Drought Indices), with the area of 1989 drought being smaller and shifting westward relative to 1988. Rings were subdivided into four equal segments from which holocellulose was separated. The range of d13C variation within each ring was typically 1\textendash{}2\% for both years, and the single site where all three species co-occurred revealed coherent seasonal d13C patterns for the pines but no correlation of the spruce d13C patterns with those of the pines. Various averaged combinations of monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and precipitation assigned to each subdivision versus both d13C and discrimination (D ÓÄÅ d13Cair ÓÄÇ d13Cplant) yielded significant correlations (generally higher with PDSI) and even stronger correlations when the spruce data were removed. The fraction of average monthly cumulative precipitation (relative to 1900\textendash{}2001 means) for these 2 years was more strongly related to d13C than either monthly precipitation or monthly fraction of average precipitation, but was not as strongly related to d13C as was PDSI. Furthermore, the pattern of increasing d13C in 1988 observed at several sites is an indicator of the increasing moisture stress of that year, and the difference between the 1988 and 1989 average isotopic compositions of the third and fourth subdivisions matched the regional moisture shift well.},

However, because those isotopic indices were developed on 5-year ring groups rather than annual rings, the full extent of their effectiveness as environmental proxies was not established. Recent re-sampling of the sites and subsequent availability of annual isotopic indices for 1985 through 1999 has allowed us to more definitively characterize environmental relationships across 14 sites in six southwestern states. Principal component (PC) analysis reveals a significant positive relationship (p \&\#8804; 0.02) between isotope indices and summer-season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a satellite-derived \&\#8220;greenness index\&\#8221;. Correlation and PC analysis also show a negative relationship of isotope indices with cumulative monthly precipitation (p \&\#8804; 0.05) and confirm a strong positive relationship with Palmer Drought Index (especially spring and summer, p \&\#8804; 0.0002). Although the drought and NDVI relationships are not as simply interconnected as hypothesized, the NDVI link reveals the potential of the existing multi-century record of isotope indices for long-term assessment of southwestern ecology and carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {Most adaptive traits are controlled by large number of genes that may all together be the targets of selection. Adaptation may thus involve multiple but not necessarily substantial allele frequency changes. This has important consequences for the detection of selected loci and implies that a quantitative genetics framework may be more appropriate than the classical 'selective sweep' paradigm. Preferred methods to detect loci involved in local adaptation are based on the detection of 'outlier' values of the allelic differentiation F(ST) . A quantitative genetics framework is adopted here to review theoretical expectations for how allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (F(STQ) ) relates to (i), neutral genetic differentiation (F(ST) ) and (ii), phenotypic differentiation (Q(ST) ). We identify cases where results of outlier-based methods are likely to be poor and where differentiation at selected loci conveys little information regarding local adaptation. A first case is when neutral differentiation is high, so that local adaptation does not necessitate increased differentiation. A second case is when local adaptation is reached via an increased covariance of allelic effects rather than via allele frequency changes, which is more likely under high gene flow when the number of loci is high and selection is recent. The comparison of theoretical predictions with observed data from the literature suggests that polygenic local adaptation involving only faint allele frequency changes are very likely in some species such as forest trees and for climate-related traits. Recent methodological improvements that may alleviate the weakness of F(ST) -based detection methods are presented.},

The generality of local adaptation in plants and whether and how it is influenced by specific species, population and habitat characteristics have, however, not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, we examined published data on the outcomes of reciprocal transplant experiments using two approaches. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the performance of local and foreign plants at all transplant sites. In addition, we analysed frequencies of pairs of plant origin to examine whether local plants perform better than foreign plants at both compared transplant sites. In both approaches, we also examined the effects of population size, and of the habitat and species characteristics that are predicted to affect local adaptation. We show that, overall, local plants performed significantly better than foreign plants at their site of origin: this was found to be the case in 71.0\% of the studied sites. However, local plants performed better than foreign plants at both sites of a pair-wise comparison (strict definition of local adaption) only in 45.3\% of the 1032 compared population pairs. Furthermore, we found local adaptation much more common for large plant populations (.1000 flowering individuals) than for small populations (,1000 flowering individuals) for which local adaptation was very rare. The degree of local adaptation was independent of plant life history, spatial or temporal habitat heterogeneity, and geographic scale. Our results suggest that local adaptation is less common in plant populations than generally assumed. Moreover, our findings reinforce the fundamental importance of population size for evolutionary theory. The clear role of population size for the ability to evolve local adaptation raises considerable doubt on the ability of small plant populations to cope with changing environments.},

In a perennial, outcrossing model plant Arabidopsis lyrata, several differentiated phenotypic traits contribute to local adaptation, as demonstrated by fitness advantage of the local population at each site in reciprocal transplant experiments. Here we compared fitness components, hierarchical total fitness and differentiation in putatively ecologically important traits of plants from two diverged parental populations from different continents in the native climate conditions of the populations in Norway and in North Carolina (NC, U.S.A.). Survival and number of fruits per inflorescence indicated local advantage at both sites and aster life-history models provided additional evidence for local adaptation also at the level of hierarchical total fitness. Populations were also differentiated in flowering start date and floral display. We also included reciprocal experimental F-1 and F-2 hybrids to examine the genetic basis of adaptation. Surprisingly, the F-2 hybrids showed heterosis at the study site in Norway, likely because of a combination of beneficial dominance effects from different traits.

  abstract = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a `consumer's guide' to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient `reference' prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new `default' prior for any Bayesian model.},

The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species, which are characterized by faster population turnover. Our study shows that climate change affects the spatial core of the distributional range of plant species, in addition to their distributional margins, as previously reported.},

We have investigated the case of local adaptation of the mosquito Culex pipiens to organophosphate insecticides in the Montpellier area in France. We have analyzed the modification of the clinal patterns at two resistance loci during the period from breeding to overwintering. We show that mosquitoes migrate extensively from breeding to overwintering sites at a rate that is markedly different from previous estimates made during the breeding season only. This migration is also strongly asymmetrical, which can be explained by different geographical distributions of breeding and overwintering sites, by variation in mosquito density along the transect, or by behavioral biases. We found that the starting time of overwintering is likely to vary between northern and southern populations and that substantial fitness costs are associated with resistance alleles at the two loci during overwintering. These results illustrate how demography and adaptive microevolution can be studied using selected markers. The method provides a framework to use population genetics and statistical models to reveal ecological and evolutionary processes.},

  abstract = {Most models describing the evolution of recombination have focused on the case of a single population, implicitly assuming that all individuals are equally likely to mate and that spatial heterogeneity in selection is absent. In these models, the evolution of recombination is driven by linkage disequilibria generated either by epistatic selection or drift. Models based on epistatic selection show that recombination can be favored if epistasis is negative and weak compared to directional selection and if the recombination modifier locus is tightly linked to the selected loci. In this article, we examine the joint effects of spatial heterogeneity in selection and epistasis on the evolution of recombination. In a model with two patches, each subject to different selection regimes, we consider the cases of mutation-selection and migration-selection balance as well as the spread of beneficial alleles. We find that including spatial heterogeneity extends the range of epistasis over which recombination can be favored. Indeed, recombination can be favored without epistasis, with negative and even with positive epistasis depending on environmental circumstances. The selection pressure acting on recombination-modifier loci is often much stronger with spatial heterogeneity, and even loosely linked modifiers and free linkage may evolve. In each case, predicting whether recombination is favored requires knowledge of both the type of environmental heterogeneity and epistasis, as none of these factors alone is sufficient to predict the outcome.},

Here we distinguish three types of stochasticity: stochasticity of mutation and variation, of individual life histories and of environmental change. We then explain when stochasticity matters in evolution, distinguishing four broad situations: stochasticity contributes to maladaptation or limits adaptation; it drives evolution on flat fitness landscapes (evolutionary freedom); it might promote jumps from one fitness peak to another (evolutionary revolutions); and it might shape the selection pressures themselves. We show that stochasticity, by directly steering evolution, has become an essential ingredient of evolutionary theory beyond the classical Wright-Fisher or neutralist-selectionist debates. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolutionary history of conifers provides an opportunity to explore these dynamics, because the majority of extant conifer species belong to lineages that have been broadly confined to the Northern or Southern Hemisphere during the Cenozoic. Incorporating genetic information with a critical review of fossil evidence, we developed an age-calibrated phylogeny sampling {$\sim$}80\% of living conifer species. Most extant conifer species diverged recently during the Neogene within clades that generally were established during the later Mesozoic, but lineages that diversified mainly in the Southern Hemisphere show a significantly older distribution of divergence ages than their counterparts in the Northern Hemisphere. Our tree topology and divergence times also are best fit by diversification models in which Northern Hemisphere conifer lineages have higher rates of species turnover than Southern Hemisphere lineages. The abundance of recent divergences in northern clades may reflect complex patterns of migration and range shifts during climatic cycles over the later Neogene leading to elevated rates of speciation and extinction, whereas the scattered persistence of mild, wetter habitats in the Southern Hemisphere may have favored the survival of older lineages.},

Despite the importance of this mechanism in understanding reproduction in living conifers and in extinct seed plants with similar morphologies, experiments designed to test its effectiveness have yielded equivocal results. \textbullet{} In vitro and in vivo pollination experiments using saccate and nonsaccate pollen were performed using modeled ovules and two Pinus species during their natural pollination period. \textbullet{} Buoyant saccate pollen readily floated through aqueous droplets, separating these grains from nonbuoyant pollen and spores. Ovules that received saccate pollen, nonsaccate pollen or a mixture of both all showed larger amounts and higher proportions of saccate pollen inside ovules after drop secretion. \textbullet{} These results demonstrate that flotation is an effective mechanism of pollen capture and transport in gymnosperms, and suggest that the prevalence of saccate grains and downward-facing ovules in the evolutionary history of seed plants is a result of the widespread use of this mechanism.},

Life-history-mediated processes such as Allee effects and dispersal capability may interact with climate variability and site-specific factors to govern population success and failure over extended time frames. We studied four disjunct populations of ponderosa pine in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming to examine population growth spanning more than five centuries. The study populations are separated from continuous ponderosa pine forest by distances ranging from 15 to .100 km. Strong evidence indicates that the initial colonizing individuals are still present, yielding a nearly complete record of population history. All trees in each population were aged using dendroecological techniques. The populations were all founded between 1530 and 1655 cal yr CE. All show logistic growth patterns, with initial exponential growth followed by a slowing during the mid to late 20th century. Initial population growth was slower than expectations from a logistic regression model at all four populations, but increased during the mid-18th century. Initial lags in population growth may have been due to strong Allee effects. A combination of overcoming Allee effects and a transition to favorable climate conditions may have facilitated a mid-18th century pulse in population growth rate.},

This perspective has had wide-ranging impacts on rural development policy which, in the uplands, has long favoured forest conservation over agriculture. Integrating soil erosion and water sediment data with local perceptions of land degradation in an upland village of northern Laos, this study tests the validity of the official environmental discourse. Biophysical measurements made in a small agricultural catchment indicate a significant correlation between the spatial extent of cultivation and soil erosion rates. However, sediment yields recorded at the outlet of the catchment highlight relatively low levels of off-site sediment exportation. Furthermore, farmers' perceptions suggest that local land degradation issues and crop yield declines could be less related to soil erosion than to agricultural land shortage, increased weed competition, and fertility losses resulting from the intensification of shifting cultivation. The study concludes that a better understanding and management of land degradation issues can be achieved by developing more inclusive and scientifically-informed approaches to environmental perceptions and narratives.},

  abstract = {Trees growing in natural systems undergo seasonal changes in environmental factors that generate seasonal differences in net photosynthetic rates. To examine how seasonal changes in the environment affect the response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2, we grew Pinus taeda L. seedlings for three growing seasons in open-top chambers continuously maintained at either ambient or ambient + 30 Pa CO2. Seedlings were grown in the ground, under natural conditions of light, temperature and nutrient and water availability. Photosynthetic capacity was measured bimonthly using net photosynthetic rate vs. intercellular CO2 partial pressure (A-C-i) curves. Maximum Rubisco activity (Vc(max) and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration capacity mediated by electron transport (J(max)) and phosphate regeneration (PiRC) were calculated from A-C-i curves using a biochemically based model. Rubisco activity, activation state and content, and leaf carbohydrate, chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations were measured concurrently with photosynthesis measurements. This paper presents results from the second and third years of treatment. Mean leaf nitrogen concentrations ranged from 13.7 to 23.8 mg g(-1), indicating that seedlings were not nitrogen deficient. Relative to ambient CO2 seedlings, elevated CO2 increased light-saturated net photosynthetic rates 60-110\% during the summer, but {$<$} 30\% during the winter. A relatively strong correlation between leaf temperature and the relative response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2 suggests a strong effect of leaf temperature. During the third growing season, elevated CO2 reduced Rubisco activity 30\% relative to ambient CO2 seedlings, nearly completely balancing Rubisco and RuBP- regeneration regulation of photosynthesis. However, reductions in Rubisco activity did not eliminate the seasonal pattern in the relative response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2. These results indicate that seasonal differences in the relative response of net photosynthetic rates to elevated CO2 are likely to occur in natural systems.},

  abstract = {Global environmental changes may be altering the ecology of tropical forests. Long-term monitoring plots have provided much of the evidence for large-scale, directional changes in tropical forests, but the results have been controversial. Here we review evidence from six complementary approaches to understanding possible changes: plant physiology experiments, long-term monitoring plots, ecosystem flux techniques, atmospheric measurements, Earth observations, and global-scale vegetation models. Evidence from four of these approaches suggests that large-scale, directional changes are occurring in the ecology of tropical forests, with the other two approaches providing inconclusive results. Collectively, the evidence indicates that both gross and net primary productivity has likely increased over recent decades, as have tree growth, recruitment, and mortality rates, and forest biomass. These results suggest a profound reorganization of tropical forest ecosystems. We evaluate the most likely drivers of the suite of changes, and suggest increasing resource availability, potentially from rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is the most likely cause.},

This type of data can be used to quickly identify genes that control important ecological and evolutionary phenotypes by finding the targets of adaptive natural selection, and we therefore refer to such approaches as "reverse ecology." To quantify the power gained in detecting positive selection using population genomic data, we compare three statistical methods for identifying targets of selection: the McDonald-Kreitman test, the mkprf method, and a likelihood implementation for detecting d(N)/d(S) {$>$} 1. Because the first two methods use polymorphism data we expect them to have more power to detect selection. However, when applied to population genomic datasets from human, fly, and yeast, the tests using polymorphism data were actually weaker in two of the three datasets. We explore reasons why the simpler comparative method has identified more genes under selection, and suggest that the different methods may really be detecting different signals from the same sequence data. Finally, we find several statistical anomalies associated with the mkprf method, including an almost linear dependence between the number of positively selected genes identified and the prior distributions used. We conclude that interpreting the results produced by this method should be done with some caution.},

In a series of common garden experiments, bud phenology, cold hardiness, and seedling growth traits were assessed for 254 populations in the interior spruce complex (Picea glauca, P.~engelmannii, and their hybrids) and for 281 populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Complex multitrait adaptations to different ecological regions such as boreal, montane, coastal, and arid environments accounted for 15-20\% of the total variance. This population differentiation could be directly linked to climate variables through multivariate regression tree analysis. Our results suggest that adaptation to climate does not always correspond linearly to temperature gradients. For example, opposite trait values (e.g., early versus late budbreak) may be found in response to apparently similar cold environments (e.g., boreal and montane). Climate change adaptation strategies may therefore not always be possible through a simple shift of seed sources along environmental gradients. For the two species in this study, we identified a relatively small number of uniquely adapted populations (11 for interior spruce and nine for lodgepole pine) that may be used to manage adaptive variation under current and expected future climates.},

  abstract = {There is substantial interest in uncovering the genetic basis of the traits underlying adaptive responses in tree species, as this information will ultimately aid conservation and industrial endeavors across populations, generations, and environments. Fundamentally, the characterization of such genetic bases is within the context of a genetic architecture, which describes the mutlidimensional relationship between genotype and phenotype through the identification of causative variants, their relative location within a genome, expression, pleiotropic effect, environmental influence, and degree of dominance, epistasis, and additivity. Here, we review theory related to polygenic local adaptation and contextualize these expectations with methods often used to uncover the genetic basis of traits important to tree conservation and industry. A broad literature survey suggests that most tree traits generally exhibit considerable heritability, that underlying quantitative genetic variation (QST) is structured more so across populations than neutral expectations (FST) in 69\% of comparisons across the literature, and that single-locus associations often exhibit small estimated per-locus effects. Together, these results suggest differential selection across populations often acts on tree phenotypes underlain by polygenic architectures consisting of numerous small to moderate effect loci. Using this synthesis, we highlight the limits of using solely single-locus approaches to describe underlying genetic architectures and close by addressing hurdles and promising alternatives towards such goals, remark upon the current state of tree genomics, and identify future directions for this field. Importantly, we argue, the success of future endeavors should not be predicated on the shortcomings of past studies and will instead be dependent upon the application of theory to empiricism, standardized reporting, centralized open-access databases, and continual input and review of the community's research.},

  abstract = {The extinction rate of populations is predicted to rise under increasing rates of environmental change 1\textendash{}3 . If a population experiencing increasingly stressful conditions lacks appropriate phenotypic plasticity or access to more suitable habitats, then gene-tic change may be the only way to avoid extinction 1 . Evolutionary rescue from extinction occurs when natural selection enriches a population for more stress-tolerant genetic variants 1,3 . Some experimental studies have shown that lower rates of environmental change lead to more adapted populations or fewer extinctions 4\textendash{}9 . However, there has been little focus on the genetic changes that underlie evolutionary rescue. Here we demonstrate that some evo-lutionary trajectories are contingent on a lower rate of environ-mental change. We allowed hundreds of populations of Escherichia coli to evolve under variable rates of increase in concentration of the antibiotic rifampicin. We then genetically engineered all com-binations of mutations from isolates evolved under lower rates of environmental change. By assessing fitness of these engineered strains across a range of drug concentrations, we show that certain genotypes are evolutionarily inaccessible under rapid environ-mental change. Rapidly deteriorating environments not only limit mutational opportunities by lowering population size, but they can also eliminate sets of mutations as evolutionary options. As anthropogenic activities are leading to environmental change at unprecedented rapidity 1 , it is critical to understand how the rate of environmental change affects both demographic and genetic underpinnings of evolutionary rescue. One of the first real-time evolution experiments demonstrated that evolutionary rescue from extinction is sensitive to the rate of environ-mental change 7 . In the 1880s, it was shown that protist lineages that had experienced a gradual increase in temperature over 7 years were able to thrive at 70 uC, whereas non-evolved populations rapidly went extinct when suddenly exposed to any temperature above 60 uC (ref. 7). Other experiments have explored the effect of the rate of environmental change on evolution in fruitflies 9},

The observation series were collected over a time span of 60 years (1896-1955) and were collected over most of Finland and regressed against each other in pairs to test mutual variation. In addition, two models of phenology, one based on chilling requirement, and the other assuming ontogenetic development starting from a signal from the light climate, were fitted to the phenological time series. The root mean square error of the regression models forecasting one observation series with another was quite constant for all event pairs, and the smaller the closer in time the events took place. It seems that different plant species react to climate variables in a similar manner, thus the use of the same models for different species and phenomena is justified. The light climate triggered model, albeit more simple, gave estimates that were better than those of the regression models between the events, while the average residuals of the estimates from the chilling triggered model were considerably larger. It is concluded that the chilling requirement component was redundant for prediction accuracy in the spring phenology models of boreal trees.},

  abstract = {According to prevailing theory, air temperature is the main environmental factor regulating the timing of bud burst of boreal and temperate trees. Air temperature has a dual role in this regulation. First, after the cessation of growth in autumn, prolonged exposure to chilling causes rest completion, i.e., removes the physiological growth-arresting conditions inside the bud. After rest completion, prolonged exposure to warm conditions causes ontogenetic development leading to bud burst or flowering. During the past three decades, several simulation models based on chilling and forcing have been developed and tested. In recent modeling studies of the timing of bud burst in mature trees, the simpler thermal-time models that assume forcing starts on a fixed date in the spring have outperformed the chilling-forcing models. We hypothesize that this discrepancy may be due to some element missing from the chilling-forcing models. We tested two new model formulations by introducing reversing, temperature-driven elements that precede forcing and by fitting the models to seven historical time series of data of flowering and leaf bud burst of common boreal tree species. In these tests, both of the new models were generally more accurate in predicting the timing of bud burst than a classical chilling-forcing model, but less accurate than the simple thermal-time model. We therefore conclude that besides chilling, other environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the timing of bud burst. Further work is needed to determine if the regulatory factors derive from air temperature or from some other environmental condition such as changes in light conditions, like day length or night length.},

We used phenological records from Oulainen-Ohineva (64 degrees 13' N, 24 degrees 53' E) in central Finland from 1953 to 2002 to estimate model parameters. We tested the models with data collected in all but six years between 1896 and 2002 in southern and central Finland; we divided this dataset into two 50-year datasets. The use of three datasets enabled us to test the models with data that were independent of the parameter fitting data, facilitating robust evaluation of model performance. Several models that fitted the parameterization data well showed poorer performance when tested with the independent data. This may be because the models were over-parameterized and able to adapt to noise in the data in addition to the phenological phenomenon itself. Simple Thermal Time models performed best with independent data, and Sequential and Parallel models were similar in prediction accuracy. Although Thermal Time models simulated boreal phenological events under current climatic conditions, some precautions are needed with simulations of climatic warming. For example, changed conditions may increase the relative importance of chilling in the timing of bud burst under elevated temperature conditions, which could alter the performance of phenological models.},

  abstract = {While current projections of future climate change associated with increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases have a high degree of uncertainty, the potential effects of climate change on forests are of increasing concern. A number of studies based on forest simulation models predict substantial alteration of forest composition, forest dieback, or even loss of forest cover in response to increased temperatures associated with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, the structure of these computer models may cause them to overemphasize the role of climate in controlling tree growth and mortality. Model functions that represent the influence of climate on tree growth are based on the geographic range limits of a species, predicting maximal growth in the center of the range and zero growth (100\% mortality) at the range limits and beyond. This modeling approach ignores the fact that the geographic range of a species reflects the influence of both climate and other environmental factors, including competition with other tree species, soil characteristics, barriers to dispersal, and distributions of pests and pathogens. These climate- response functions in forest simulation models implicitly assume that tree species occur in all environments where it is possible for them to survive (their fundamental niche or potential habitat) and that these potential habitats are entirely defined by climate. Hence, any alteration of climate must result in a fairly rapid decline of species near their range limits and rapid alteration of forest composition and structure. The climate- response functions that lead to these unrealistic conclusions have no basis in plant physiology or actual measurements of tree responses to climate stressors. Rather, these functions were chosen as a necessary expedient for modeling the climatic responses of many tree species for which there were limited or no ecophysiological data. There is substantial evidence, however, that some tree species can survive, and even thrive, in climatic conditions outside their present range limits. This evidence suggests that nonclimatic factors exclude some species from natural forests beyond their present range limits and that climate may not be the only determinant of these limits. Hence, there is reason to suspect that published projections of t responses to climate change based on forest simulation models may exaggerate the direct impact of climate on tree growth and mortality. We propose that forest simulation models be reformulated with more realistic representations of growth responses to temperature, moisture, mortality, and dispersal. We believe that only when these models more accurately reflect the physiological bases of the responses of tree species to climate variables can they be used to simulate responses of forests to rapid changes in climate. We argue that direct forest responses to climate change projected by such a reformulated model may be less traumatic and more gradual than those projected by current models. However, the indirect effects of climate change on forests, mediated by alterations of disturbance regimes or the actions of pests and pathogens, may accelerate climate-induced change in forests, and they deserve further study and inclusion within forest stimulation models.},

  abstract = {Riparian spider abundance is influenced by the extent and architecture of litter, which is greatly influenced by flood regime. Flood-deposited clumps of intertwined plant material and inorganic debris (``litter hovels'') attached to trees and elevated above the ground by past high water events present a unique, persistent, and unstudied habitat type for spiders. We investigated spider use of litter hovels along an unregulated reach of West Clear Creek, Arizona, USA dominated by native riparian vegetation. Ninety two percent of litter hovels were occupied by at least one spider, with a mean occupancy of 4.5 spiders per hovel. Spider abundance and diversity at the family level were positively correlated with litter hovel size. Furthermore, spiders were non-randomly distributed among litter hovels in three areas of this riparian system: the vegetated floodplain, creek edges, and islands within the creek channel. Overall spider diversity was two-fold greater on creek islands than in the vegetated floodplain, and spider abundance also varied by predation guild among the three habitat types. Running and web-building spiders were most abundant on creek islands, while stalking and ambushing spiders were two-fold more abundant along creek edges in comparison with other habitats. For this riparian system, we estimate that spider densities could reach 270,000/ha in hovels alone, and therefore alteration of flood regimes through stream management may have important implications for arthropod dynamics. Current efforts to restore natural flood regimes and native vegetation in Southwestern streams are likely to benefit spider populations, their predators, and the regulation of herbivorous arthropods.},

We compare an ecological nutrient-plant-herbivore food-chain model without evolution with the same model, including herbivore evolution, plant evolution, or both. When only herbivores are allowed to evolve, the predictions are similar to those of the ecological model without evolution, i.e., plant biomass does not change with nutrient addition. When only plants evolve, nutrient enrichment leads to an increase in the biomass of all compartments. In contrast, when plants and herbivores are allowed to coevolve, although these two classical patterns are common, a wide variety of other responses is possible. The form of the trade-offs that constrain evolution of the two protagonists is then critical. This stresses the need for experimental data on phenotypic traits, their costs and their influence on the interactions between organisms and the rest of the community. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Episodic outbreaks are a common occurrence in the beetles' primary host, lodgepole pine. Current outbreaks, however, are occurring in habitats where outbreaks either did not previously occur or were limited in scale. Herein, we address widespread, ongoing outbreaks in high-elevation, whitebark pine forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where, due to an inhospitable climate, past outbreaks were infrequent and short lived. We address the basic question: are these outbreaks truly unprecedented and a threat to ecosystem continuity? In order to evaluate this question we (1) present evidence that the current outbreak is outside the historic range of variability; (2) examine system resiliency to MPB disturbance based on adaptation to disturbance and host defenses to MPB attack; and (3) investigate the potential domain of attraction to large-scale MPB disturbance based on thermal developmental thresholds, spatial structure of forest types, and the confounding influence of an introduced pathogen. We conclude that the loss of dominant whitebark pine forests, and the ecological services they provide, is likely under continuing climate warming and that new research and strategies are needed to respond to the crisis facing whitebark pine.},

Overfishing of herbivores is particularly detrimental, as it makes the coral system more likely to undergo shifts to macroalgal dominance in the event of coral mass mortality. Knowing when important processes, such as herbivory, are becoming brittle is important because it can provide an opportunity for managers to avoid undesirable ecosystem-level changes. This study investigates the impact of artisanal fishing on three important functional groups of herbivores (grazers, scrapers and excavators) on five coral-dominated reefs outside Zanzibar (Tanzania). There was a negative correlation between fishing pressure and fish biomass, abundance, diversity and species richness. Moreover, fishing had a negative influence on the demographic structure of functional groups, particularly excavators, manifesting itself as a skewness towards smaller individuals within populations. Artisanal fishing can have significant impacts on key functional groups of herbivorous reef fishes which may increase the vulnerability of coral reefs to undesirable ecosystem shifts.},

In the longer term this increase is often offset by downregulation of photosynthetic capacity.

  abstract = {Effective dispersal is crucial to species inhabiting transient substrates in order for them to be able to persist in a landscape. Bryophytes, pteridophytes, lichens and fungi all have wind-dispersed small diaspores and can be efficiently dispersed if their diaspores reach air masses above canopy height. However, empirical data on dispersal over landscape scales are scarce. We investigated how the colonization of an acrocarpous clay-inhabiting pioneer moss, Discelium nudum, varied between sites that differed in connectivity to potential dispersal sources at spatial scales from 1 to 20 km in a region in northern Sweden. We recorded the colonization on \texttildelow{}25 introduced clay heaps at each of 14 experimental sites some months after the dispersal period. The colonization rate ranged from 0\textendash{}82\% and had a statistically significant relationship with a proxy for potential habitats (amount of clay-dominated soil) in a buffer of 20 km radius surrounding the experimental sites (and also weakly with the amount of substrate in a 10 km buffer). There were no significant relationships between colonization rate and connectivity at smaller scales (1 and 5 km). We made a rough estimate of the number of spores available for dispersal in a landscape, given the amount of clay-dominated soil, by recording the number of Discelium nudum colonies in two 25 \texttimes{} 25 km landscapes. The estimated available spore numbers in the different 20 km buffers were of the same order of magnitude as the deposition densities at the experimental sites calculated from the colonization rates. The results suggest that the spores of species with scattered occurrences and small diaspores (25 {$\mu$}m) in open landscapes can be deposited over extensive areas, at rates high enough to drive colonization patterns. This also implies that regional connectivity may be more important than local connectivity for these kinds of species.},

Little is known about how bryophytes regulate spore release, but conditions affecting peristome movements and vibration of the seta may be important. We modelled airborne spore dispersal of the bryophyte species Discelium nudum (spore diameter 25 {$\mu$}m), in four different release scenarios, using a Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model and meteorological data. We tested the model predictions against experimental data on colonization success at five distances (5, 10, 30, 50 and 100 m) and eight directions from a translocated point source during seven two-day periods. The model predictions were generally successful in describing the observed colonization patterns, especially beyond 10 m. In the laboratory we established spore release thresholds; horizontal wind speed sd {$>$} 0.25 m s-1 induced the seta to vibrate and in relative humidity {$<$} 75\% the peristome was open. Our dispersal model predicts that the proportion of spores dispersing beyond 100 m is almost twice as large if the spores are released under turbulent conditions than under more stable conditions. However, including release thresholds improved the fit of the model to the colonization data only minimally, with roughly the same amount of variation explained by the most constrained scenario (assuming both vibration of the seta and an open peristome) and the scenario assuming random release. Model predictions under realised experimental conditions suggest that we had a low statistical power to rank the release scenarios due to the lack of measurements of the absolute rate of spore release. Our results hint at the importance of release conditions, but also highlight the challenges in dispersal experiments intended for validating mechanistic dispersal models.},

  abstract = {Preface Landscape ecology continues to grow as an exciting, dynamic ecological discipline. With its broadscale emphasis and multidisciplinary approach, landscape ecology lends itself both to basic research and to applications in land management, land-use planning, wildlife management, ecosystem management, and conservation biology. Landscape ecology makes a unique contribution to the scientific community in its attention to ecological dynamics across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and as a result it has become increasingly important for students in the natural sciences to gain a basic understanding of the subject. Colleges and universities across the United States are incorporating courses in landscape ecology into their curricula. However, nearly every book on landscape ecology is a book to be read, lacking a hands-on approach. This text is intended to fill that void by providing a comprehensive collection of landscape ecology laboratory exercises. These teaching exercises stress the fundamental concepts of landscape ecology, rather than highly specialized, technical methods. While students will gain experience using a variety of tools commonly used in landscape ecology, we stress the conceptual understanding necessary to use these techniques appropriately. This book attempts to convey the myriad approaches used by landscape ecologists (as well as a multitude of approaches to teaching) and include group discussion, thought problems, fieldwork, data analysis, spatial data collection, exposure to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), simulation modeling, analysis of landscape metrics, spatial statistics, and written exercises. This book is divided into seven sections, which complement the companion textbook, Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice: Pattern and Process, by M. G. Turner, R. H. Gardner, and R. V. O{\^a}texttrademarkNeill. However, this textbook is also a useful stand-alone volume that can be used for teaching and learning. We also hope practicing landscape ecologists will find this book to be a useful reference.},

A challenge arising from the application of this technology is the utilization of short-term FACE results for predicting long-term ecosystem responses. This modeling study was designed to explore interactions of various processes on ecosystem productivity at elevated CO2 on the decadal scale. We used a forest model (FORDYN) to analyze CO2 responses----particularly soil nitrogen dynamics, carbon production and storage----of a loblolly pine ecosystem in the Duke University Forest. When a 14-year-old stand was exposed to elevated CO2, simulated increases in annual net primary productivity (NPP) were 13, 10 and 7.5\% in Years 1, 2 and 10, respectively, compared with values at ambient CO2. Carbon storage increased by 4\% in trees and 9.2\% in soil in Year 10 in response to elevated CO2. When the ecosystem was exposed to elevated CO2 from the beginning of forest regrowth, annual NPP and carbon storage in trees and soil were increased by 32, 18 and 20\%, respectively, compared with values at ambient CO2. In addition, simulation of a 20\% increase in mineralization rate led to a slight increase in biomass growth and carbon storage, but the simulated 20\% increase in fine root turnover rate considerably increased annual NPP and carbon storage in soil. The modeling results indicated that (1) stimulation of NPP and carbon storage by elevated CO2 is transient and (2) effects of elevated CO2 on ecosystem processes----canopy development, soil nitrogen mineralization and root turnover----have great impacts on ecosystem C dynamics. A detailed understanding of these processes will improve our ability to predict long-term ecosystem responses to CO2 enrichment.},

This review focuses on the major nutrients, namely N and P, and deals with the effects of climate change on the processes that alter their cycling and availability. Current knowledge regarding biotic and abiotic agents of weathering, mobilization and immobilization of these elements will be discussed. To date, controlled environment studies have identified possible effects of climate change on tree nutrition. Only some of these findings, however, were verified in ecosystem scale experiments. Moreover, to be able to predict future effects of climate change on tree nutrition at this scale, we need to progress from studying effects of single factors to analysing interactions between factors such as elevated CO2, temperature or water availability.},

  abstract = {One of the most desirable goals of scientific endeavor is to discover laws or principles behind ''mystified'' phenomena. A cherished example is the discovery of the law of universal gravitation by Isaac Newton, which can precisely describe falling of an apple from a tree and predict the existence of Neptune. Scientists pursue mechanistic understanding of natural phenomena in an attempt to develop relatively simple equations with a small number of parameters to describe patterns in nature and to predict changes in the future. In this context, uncertainty had been considered to be incom-patible with science (Klir 2006). Not until the early 20th century was the notion gradually changed when physicists studied the behavior of matter and energy on the scale of atoms and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics. In 1927, Heisenberg observed that the electron could not be considered as in an exact location, but rather in points of probable location in its orbital, which can be described by a probability distribution (Heisenberg 1958). Quantum mechanics lets scientists realize that inherent uncertainty exists in nature and is an unavoidable and essential property of most systems. Since then, scientists have developed methods to analyze and describe uncertainty. Ecosystem ecologists have recently directed attention to studying uncertainty in ecosystem processes. The Bayesian paradigm allows ecologists to generate a posteriori probabilistic density functions (PDF) for parameters of ecosystem models by assimilating a priori PDFs and measurements (Dowd and Meyer 2003). Xu et al. (2006), for example, evaluated uncertainty in parameter estimation and projected carbon sinks by a Bayesian framework using six data sets and a terrestrial ecosystem (TECO) model. The Bayesian framework has been applied to assimilation of eddy-flux data into simplified photosynthesis and evapotranspiration model (SIPNET) to evaluate information content of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) observations for constraints of process parameters (e.g., Braswell et al. 2005) and to partition NEE into its component fluxes (Sacks et al. 2006). Verstraeten et al. (2008) evaluate error propaga-tion and uncertainty of evaporation, soil moisture content, and net ecosystem productivity with remotely sensed data assimilation. Nevertheless, uncertainty in data assimilation with ecosystem models has not been systematically explored. Cressie et al. (2009) proposed a general framework to account for multiple sources of uncertainty in measure-ments, in sampling, in specification of the process, in parameters, and in initial and boundary conditions. They proposed to separate the multiple sources of uncertainty using a conditional-probabilistic approach. With this approach, ecologists need to build a hierarch-ical statistical model based on the Bayesian theorem, and to use Markov chain Monte Carlos (MCMC) techniques for sampling before probability distributions of interested parameters or projected state variables can be obtained for quantification of uncertainty. It is an elegant framework for quantifying uncertainties in the parameters and processes of ecological models. At the core of uncertainty analysis is parameter identifiability. When parameters can be constrained by a set of data with a given model structure, we can identify maximum likelihood values of the parameters and then those parameters are identifiable. Conversely, there is an issue of equifinality in data assimilation (Beven 2006) that different models, or different parameter values of the same model, may fit data equally well without the ability to distinguish which models or parameter values are better than others. Thus, the issue of identifiability is reflected by parameter constraint and equifinality. This essay first reviews the current status of our knowledge on parameter identifiability and then discusses major factors that influence it. To enrich discussion, we use examples in ecosystem ecology that are different from the one on population dynamics of harbor seals in Cressie et al. (2009). CURRENT STATUS},

However, whether temporal increases in tree mortality are attributed to climate change or stand developmental processes remains uncertain. Furthermore, interpreting the climate change-associated tree mortality estimated from old forests for regional forests rests on an un-tested assumption that the effects of climate change are the same for young and old forests. Here we disentangle the effects of climate change and stand developmental processes on tree mortality. We show that both climate change and forest development processes influence temporal mortality increases, climate change-associated increases are significantly higher in young than old forests, and higher increases in younger forests are a result of their higher sensitivity to regional warming and drought. We anticipate our analysis to be a starting point for more comprehensive examinations of how forest ecosystems might respond to climate change.},

It is also broadly assumed for forest tree species that show genetic differentiation among geographic populations, especially for those with widespread natural distributions that occur in distinct environments. However, due to a scarcity of suitable data, the inference of local adaptation has rarely been validated for forest tree species through reciprocal transplant experiments (RTEs). In this study, we illustrate a novel approach to restructure tree provenance test data to conform to RTEs and use recently proposed statistical models to detect local adaptation, using white spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss as an example. Our research demonstrates how similar studies can be conducted to validate local adaptation in other forest species and populations, for which RTEs are lacking, but where large, high-quality provenance test data sets are available. Contrary to common belief, our results show that local adaptation is absent in survival and height for white spruce populations from Ontario, Canada, although they have evolved in considerably different climatic habitats, and exhibit substantial and clinal genetic differentiation and significant genotype-by-environment interactions in these two adaptive traits. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the common assumption of local adaptation in forest tree species may not necessarily be correct within significant portions of their natural range. In forest genetic studies, population differentiation in adaptive traits has often been attributed to local adaptation without rigorous validation. Our results caution against such interpretation of experimental results. In the absence of local adaptation as shown by reciprocal transplant experiments, assisted migration may be considered as an option for enhancing forest adaptation to climate change.},

We demonstrate that density-dependent dispersal probability can act as a mechanism for coexistence of otherwise non-coexisting competitors. We show that in time-varying habitats, an intermediate dispersal probability will evolve. Analytically, we find that the spreading speed for the integrodifference equation with density-dependent dispersal probability is not linearly determined. Furthermore, the next-generation operator is not compact and, in general, neither order-preserving nor monotonicity-preserving. We give two explicit examples of non-monotone, discontinuous traveling-wave profiles.},

The way in which they differ is related to the specialized ways they have of using resources, which ways in turn control numbers of coexisting species and other aspects of the evolution of the comnmunity. The detailed reasons for these assertions are given in the following paragraphs.2 Briefly, the argument is as follows. Among species which specialize on a single uniform resource, only the most effective one will survive and that species will be found wherever the resource occurs, in abundance determined by the density of the resource. Other such pure specialist species will be found, one to a uniform resource; these will normally differ in morphology, but will not in general be affected by one another's distributions. On the other hand, species which specialize on a particular proportion of mixture of two or more particular resources will be found only where their favored proportion is found, and will be replaced by other species in other habitats where the proportion of the mixture changes to one on which the new species are more effective. Of this mixed-resource type of species there can be as many3 as there are proportions of the resources which can be counted on from season to season-i.e., very many in stable climates and fewer in unpredictable climates.},

Here, we show that temperature alone cannot realistically explain high-elevation tree cover over a {$>$}100-km(2) area in the Canadian Rockies and that geologic/geomorphic processes are fundamental to understanding the heterogeneous landscape distribution of trees. Furthermore, upslope tree advance in a warmer scenario will be severely limited by availability of sites with adequate geomorphic/topographic characteristics. Our results imply that landscape-to-regional scale projections of warming-induced, high-elevation forest advance into alpine areas should not be based solely on temperature-sensitive, site-specific upper-treeline studies but also on geomorphic processes that control tree occurrence at long (centuries/millennia) timescales.},

  abstract = {Climate change is disrupting historical patterns of adaptation in temperate and boreal tree species, causing local populations to become maladapted. Tree improvement programs typically utilise local base populations and manage adaptation using geographically defined breeding zones. As climates shift, breeding zones are no longer optimal seed deployment zones because base populations are becoming dissociated from their historical climatic optima. In response, climate-based seed transfer (CBST) policies incorporating assisted gene flow (AGF) are being adopted to pre-emptively match reforestation seedlots with future climates, but their implementation requires accurate knowledge of genetic variation in climatically adaptive traits. Here we use lodgepole pine as a case study to evaluate the effects of selective conifer breeding on adaptive traits and their climatic associations to inform CBST and AGF prescriptions. Our approach compared 105 natural stand and 20 selectively bred lodgepole pine seedlots from Alberta and British Columbia grown in a common garden of {$\sim$}2200 seedlings. The effects of selection on phenotypic variation and climatic associations among breeding zones were assessed for growth, phenology and cold hardiness. We found substantial differences between natural and selected seedlings in growth traits, but timing of growth initiation was unaffected, growth cessation was delayed slightly (average 4 days, range 0.7 days to 10 days), and cold injury was slightly greater (average 2.5\%, range -7\% to 11\%) in selected seedlings. Phenotypic differentiation among breeding zones and climatic clines were stronger for all traits in selected seedlings. Height gains resulted from both increased growth rate and delayed growth cessation, but negative indirect effects of selection on cold hardiness were weak. Selection, breeding and progeny testing combined have produced taller lodgepole pine seedlings that are not adaptively compromised relative to their natural seedling counterparts. Selective breeding produces genotypes that achieve increased height growth and maintain climate adaptation, rather than reconstituting genotypes similar to populations adapted to warmer climates. While CBST is needed to optimise seedlot deployment in new climates, but an absence of systematic indirect selection effects on adaptive traits suggests natural and selected seedlots do not require separate AGF prescriptions.},

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged {$\geq$}60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province's area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC's ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.},

Using a seedling common garden trial of 281 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) populations from across western Canada, we compare genomic data to phenotypic and climatic data to assess their effectiveness in characterizing the climatic drivers and spatial scale of local adaptation in this species. We find that phenotype-associated loci are equivalent or slightly superior to climate data for describing local adaptation in seedling traits, but that climate data are superior to genomic data that have not been selected for phenotypic associations. We also find agreement between the climate variables associated with genomic variation and with 20-year heights from a long-term provenance trial, suggesting that genomic data may be a viable option for identifying climatic drivers of local adaptation where phenotypic data are unavailable. Genetic clines associated with the experimental traits occur at broad spatial scales, suggesting that standing variation of adaptive alleles for this and similar species does not require management at scales finer than those indicated by phenotypic data. This study demonstrates that genomic data are most useful when paired with phenotypic data, but can also fill some of the traditional roles of phenotypic data in management of species for which phenotypic trials are not feasible.},

  abstract = {Aim Greenhouse-induced warming and resulting shifts in climatic zones may exceed the migration capabilities of some species. We used fourteen combinations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) to investigate possible migration rates required under CO2-doubled climatic forcing. Location Global. Methods Migration distances were calculated between grid cells of future biome type x and nearest same-biome-type cells in the current climate. In 'base-case' calculations, we assumed that 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate forcing would occur in 100 years, we used ten biome types and we measured migration distances as straight-line distances ignoring water barriers and human development. In sensitivity analyses, we investigated different time periods of 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate forcing, more narrowly defined biomes and barriers because of water bodies and human development. Results In the base-case calculations, average migration rates varied significantly according to the GVM used (BIOME3 vs. MAPSS), the age of the GCM (older- vs. newer-generation GCMs), and whether or not GCMs included sulphate cooling or CO2 fertilization effects. However, high migration rates ({$\geq$} 1000 m year-1) were relatively common in all models, consisting on average of 17\% grid cells for BIOME3 and 21\% for MAPSS. Migration rates were much higher in boreal and temperate biomes than in tropical biomes. Doubling of the time period of 2 \texttimes{} CO2 forcing reduced these areas of high migration rates to c. 12\% of grid cells for both BIOME3 and MAPSS. However, to obtain migration rates in the Boreal biome that were similar in magnitude to those observed for spruce when it followed the retreating North American Glacier, a radical increase in the period of warming was required, from 100 to {$>$} 1000 years. A reduction in biome area by an order of magnitude increased migration rates by one to three orders of magnitude, depending on the GVM. Large water bodies and human development had regionally important effects in increasing migration rates. Main conclusions In conclusion, evidence from coupled GCMs and GVMs suggests that global warming may require migration rates much faster than those observed during post-glacial times and hence has the potential to reduce biodiversity by selecting for highly mobile and opportunistic species. Several poorly understood factors that are expected to influence the magnitude of any such reduction are discussed, including intrinsic migrational capabilities, barriers to migration, the role of outlier populations in increasing migration rates, the role of climate in setting range limits and variation in species range sizes.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

Although we have begun to understand the molecular basis of adaptation in those species for which whole genome sequences are available, the molecular basis of adaptation is still poorly understood for most non-model species. In this paper, we outline major challenges and future research directions for correlating environmental factors with molecular markers to identify adaptive genetic variation, and point to research gaps in the application of landscape genetics to real-world problems arising from global change, such as the ability of organisms to adapt over rapid time scales. High throughput sequencing generates vast quantities of molecular data to address the challenge of studying adaptive genetic variation in non-model species. Here, we suggest that improvements in the sampling design should consider spatial dependence among sampled individuals. Then, we describe available statistical approaches for integrating spatial dependence into landscape analyses of adaptive genetic variation.},

  abstract = {Deleterious mutations tend to be recessive. Several theories, notably those of Fisher (based on selection) and Wright (based on metabolism), have been put forward to explain this pattern. Despite a long-lasting debate, the matter remains unresolved. This debate has focused on the average dominance of mutations. However, we also know very little about the distribution of dominance coefficients among mutations, and about its variation across environments. In this article we present a new approach to predicting this distribution. Our approach is based on a phenotypic fitness landscape model. First, we show that under a very broad range of conditions (and environments), the average dominance of mutation of small effects should be approximately one-quarter as long as adaptation of organisms to their environment can be well described by stabilizing selection on an arbitrary set of phenotypic traits. Second, the theory allows predicting the whole distribution of dominance coefficients among mutants. Because it provides quantitative rather than qualitative predictions, this theory can be directly compared to data. We found that its prediction on mean dominance (average dominance close to 0.25) agreed well with the data, based on a meta-analysis of dominance data for mildly deleterious mutations. However, a simple landscape model does not account for the dominance of mutations of large effects and we provide possible extension of the theory for this class of mutations. Because dominance is a central parameter for evolutionary theory, and because these predictions are quantitative, they set the stage for a wide range of applications and further empirical tests.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pinus pollen allergy has been generally considered to be rare and clinically insignificant. In our geographical area, Pinus pollen constitutes one of the most predominant pollen together with Poaceae and Urticaceae pollen. Pinus pinaster and Pinus radiata are the main species.
OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to determine the atmospheric fluctuations and the existence of patients monosensitized to Pinus pollen in our region.
METHODS: Patients attending our outpatient clinic in the last 4 years with positive cutaneous tests to Pinus pollen and with respiratory symptoms were selected. They were skin tested with commercial extracts of a battery of inhalants including Pinus pollen. Serologic specific IgE to Pinus pollen was performed by CAP system (Pharmacia \& Upjohn, Uppsala, Sweden). Airborne Pinus pollen counts in our city were obtained for a 5-year period (1995 to 1999).
RESULTS: We present 10 patients with sensitivity to Pinus pollen and with symptomatology coinciding with Pinus pollen season (February to April). Most of these patients were monosensitizated to Pinus pollen and suffered from seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis. Pinus pollen is present in our area in large amounts from February to April with a peak pollen count in March and April.
CONCLUSIONS: Pinus pollen may be an important allergen since by itself can be the only cause of allergic disease. Therefore, we think that it must be taken into account in patients living in areas with high Pinus pollen concentrations and with seasonal respiratory disease.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {$<$}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged {$\geq$}60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

  abstract = {The evolution of complex organisms is a puzzle for evolutionary theory because beneficial mutations should be less frequent in complex organisms, an effect termed "cost of complexity." However, little is known about how the distribution of mutation fitness effects (f(s)) varies across genomes. The main theoretical framework to address this issue is Fisher's geometric model and related phenotypic landscape models. However, it suffers from several restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we intend to show how several of these limitations may be overcome. We then propose a model of f(s) that extends Fisher's model to account for arbitrary mutational and selective interactions among n traits. We show that these interactions result in f(s) that would be predicted by a much smaller number of independent traits. We test our predictions by comparing empirical f(s) across species of various gene numbers as a surrogate to complexity. This survey reveals, as predicted, that mutations tend to be more deleterious, less variable, and less skewed in higher organisms. However, only limited difference in the shape of f(s) is observed from Escherichia coli to nematodes or fruit flies, a pattern consistent with a model of random phenotypic interactions across many traits. Overall, these results suggest that there may be a cost to phenotypic complexity although much weaker than previously suggested by earlier theoretical works. More generally, the model seems to qualitatively capture and possibly explain the variation of f(s) from lower to higher organisms, which opens a large array of potential applications in evolutionary genetics.},

Forecasting the probability of persistence under stress, including emergence of drug resistance as a special case of interest, requires experimentally validated quantitative predictions. Here, we propose general analytical predictions, based on diffusion approximations, for the probability of evolutionary rescue. We assume a narrow genetic basis for adaptation to stress, as is often the case for drug resistance. First, we extend the rescue model of Orr \& Unckless (Am. Nat. 2008 172, 160-169) to a broader demographic and genetic context, allowing the model to apply to empirical systems with variation among mutation effects on demography, overlapping generations and bottlenecks, all common features of microbial populations. Second, we confront our predictions of rescue probability with two datasets from experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (bacterium). The tests show the qualitative agreement between the model and observed patterns, and illustrate how biologically relevant quantities, such as the per capita rate of rescue, can be estimated from fits of empirical data. Finally, we use the results of the model to suggest further, more quantitative, tests of evolutionary rescue theory.},

Three major patterns emerge from these disturbances: First, we show that 10 of the most common herbaceous perennial dicots benefit from pocket gopher disturbance; that is, a greater proportion of seedlings are found in the open space created by pocket gopher disturbance than would be expected based on the availability of disturbed habitat. Additionally, these seedlings exhibited higher growth rates than adjacent seedlings of the same species growing in undisturbed habitat. Second, we tested two predictions of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis and found that species diversity was greatest for plots characterized by disturbances of intermediate age. However, we did not detect significant differences in diversity between plots characterized by intermediate and high levels of disturbance, indicating that many species are adapted to or at least tolerant of high levels of disturbance. Third, we noted that the abundance of grasses decreased with increasing disturbance, while the abundance of dicots increased with increasing disturbance.},

  abstract = {Researchers employing resource selection functions (RSFs) and other related methods aim to detect correlates of space-use and mitigate against detrimental environmental change. However, an empirical model fit to data from one place or time is unlikely to capture species responses under different conditions because organisms respond nonlinearly to changes in habitat availability. This phenomenon, known as a functional response in resource selection, has been debated extensively in the RSF literature but continues to be ignored by practitioners for lack of a practical treatment. We therefore extend the RSF approach to enable it to estimate generalized functional responses (GFRs) from spatial data. GFRs employ data from several sampling instances characterized by diverse profiles of habitat availability. By modeling the regression coefficients of the underlying RSF as functions of availability, GFRs can account for environmental change and thus predict population distributions in new environments. We formulate the approach as a mixed-effects model so that it is estimable by readily available statistical software. We illustrate its application using (1) simulation and (2) wolf home-range telemetry. Our results indicate that GFRs can offer considerable improvements in estimation speed and predictive ability over existing mixed-effects approaches.},

For each of these time periods, we provide a large set of basic and derived biologically relevant climate variables, such as growing and chilling degree days, growing season length descriptors, frost free days, extreme minimum temperatures, etc. To balance file size versus accuracy for these approximately 15,000 climate surfaces, we provide a stand-alone software solution that adds or subtracts historical data and future projections as medium resolution anomalies (deviations) from the high resolution 1961-1990 baseline normal dataset. For a relative quality comparison between the original normal data generated with the Parameter Regression of Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and derived historical data, we calculated the amount of variance explained (R2) in original weather station data for each year and month from 1901 to 2006. R2values remained very high for most of the time period covered for most variables. Reduction in data quality was found for individual months (as opposed to annual, decadal or 30-year climate averages) and for the early decades of the last century.

Recent advances make the approach viable for non-specialist laboratories. The relevant literature is, however, spread across several disciplines, with common problems approached in different ways. Here we provide the first overview of isotope dendroclimatology, explaining the underlying theory and describing the steps taken in building and interpreting isotope chronologies. Stable carbon isotopes record the balance between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, dominated at dry sites by relative humidity and soil water status and at moist sites by summer irradiance and temperature. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios record source water, which contains a temperature signal, and leaf transpiration, controlled dominantly by vapour pressure deficit. Variable exchange with xylem (source) water during wood synthesis determines the relative strength of the source water and leaf enrichment signals. Producing long Holocene chronologies will require a change in emphasis towards processing very large numbers of samples efficiently, whilst retaining analytical precision. A variety of sample preparation and data treatment protocols have been used, some of which have a deleterious effect on the palaeoclimate signal. These are reviewed and suggestions made for a more standardised approach. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have used a variety of comparative mensurative and manipulative experimental approaches to study the biological consequences of habitat fragmentation. In this paper, we evaluate the merits of the two major approaches and offer guidelines for selecting a design. Manipulative experiments rigorously assess fragmentation effects by comparing pre- and post-treatment conditions. Yet they are often constrained by a number of practical limitations, such as the difficulty in implementing large-scale treatments and the impracticality of measuring the long-term (decades to centuries) responses to the imposed treatments. Comparative mensurative studies generally involve substituting space for time, and without pre-treatment control, can be constrained by variability in ecological characteristics among different landscapes. These confounding effects can seriously limit the strength of inferences. Depending on the scale of the study system and how ``landscape'' is defined, both approaches may be limited by the difficulty of replicating at the landscape scale. Overall, both mensurative and manipulative approaches have merit and can contribute to the body of knowledge on fragmentation. However, from our review of 134 fragmentation studies published recently in three major ecological journals, it is evident that most manipulative and mensurative fragmentation experiments have not provided clear insights into the ecological mechanisms and effects of habitat fragmentation. We discuss the reasons for this and conclude with recommendations for improving the design and implementation of fragmentation experiments.},

Unified theories have been important in physics including the unification of electricity and magnetism and the unification of the electromagnetic with the weak nuclear force. Surprisingly, ecology, specifically the subfields of biodiversity and macroecology, also possess not one but at least six unified theories. This is problematic as only one unified theory is desirable. Superficially, the six unified theories seem very different. However, I show that all six theories use the same three rules or assertions to describe a stochastic geometry of biodiversity. The three rules are: (1) intraspecifically individuals are clumped together; (2) interspecifically global or regional abundance varies according to a hollow curve distribution; and (3) interspecifically individuals are placed without regard to individuals of other species. These three rules appear sufficient to explain local species abundance distributions, species-area relationships, decay of similarity of distance and possibly other patterns of biodiversity. This provides a unification of the unified theories. I explore implications of this unified theory for future research.},

However, women are still more likely to leave the field of science and have lower salaries, promotion rates, and productivity than do men.

  abstract = {Habitat availability and dispersal ability are commonly the major factors controlling the distribution of habitat specialists. However, these species often have an ``under-saturated'' distribution, i.e., their habitat is more frequent than their populations. Floerkea proserpinacoides is an annual spring ephemeral plant of the deciduous forest of eastern North America. It is considered rare in most of its range. In Qu{\'e}bec (Canada), where the species reaches the northern limit of its distribution, F. proserpinacoides is mostly restricted to rich, low woods on islands of the St. Lawrence River. To elucidate the factors responsible for this peculiar distribution, we determined the dispersal ability of F. proserpinacoides nutlets and attempted to establish new populations at apparently suitable, but unoccupied sites within the species range in Qu{\'e}bec. Primary dispersal is barochorous and nutlets have no accessory structures to assist in dispersal. Secondary dispersal is also limited, and nutlets typically move distances {$<$} 50 cm from their original point of fall. Yet, nutlets are buoyant and hydrochory is a possible means of long-distance dispersal. When nutlets were introduced at apparently suitable but unoccupied sites, the seeds could germinate and the individuals completed their life cycle. However, nutlets from different populations did not have the same success. The under-saturated distribution of F. proserpinacoides in Qu{\'e}bec is not related to a lack of suitable habitat. Instead, long-distance dispersal events may be too infrequent to allow the occupation of all potential sites, or conditions may be too variable among years on certain sites to allow for population persistence.},

  abstract = {Human-caused disruptions to seed-dispersal mutualisms increase the extinction risk for both plant and animal species. Large-seeded plants can be particularly vulnerable due to highly specialized dispersal systems and no compensatory regeneration mechanisms. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a keystone subalpine species, obligately depends upon the Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for dispersal of its large, wingless seeds. Clark's Nutcracker, a facultative mutualist with whitebark pine, is sensitive to rates of energy gain, and emigrates from subalpine forests during periods of cone shortages. The invasive fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust, reduces whitebark pine cone production by killing cone-bearing branches and trees. Mortality from blister rust reaches 90\% or higher in some whitebark pine forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, and the rust now occurs nearly rangewide in whitebark pine. Our objectives were to identify the minimum level of cone production necessary to elicit seed dispersal by nutcrackers and to determine how cone production is influenced by forest structure and health. We quantified forest conditions and ecological interactions between nutcrackers and whitebark pine in three Rocky Mountain ecosystems that differ in levels of rust infection and mortality. Both the frequency of nutcracker occurrence and probability of seed dispersal were strongly related to annual whitebark pine cone production, which had a positive linear association with live whitebark pine basal area, and negative linear association with whitebark pine tree mortality and rust infection. From our data, we estimated that a threshold level of approximately 1000 cones/ha is needed for a high likelihood of seed dispersal by nutcrackers (probability {$>$} or = 0.7), and that this level of cone production can be met by forests with live whitebark pine basal area {$>$} 5.0 m2/ha. The risk of mutualism disruption is greatest in northern most Montana (USA), where three-year mean cone production and live basal area fell below predicted threshold levels. There, nutcracker occurrence, seed dispersal, and whitebark pine regeneration were the lowest of the three ecosystems. Managers can use these threshold values to differentiate between restoration sites requiring planting of rust-resistant seedlings and sites where nutcracker seed dispersal can be expected.},

  abstract = {Recent models and analyses of paleoecological records suggest that tree populations are capable of rapid migration when climate warms. Fossil pollen is commonly interpreted as suggesting that the range of many temperate tree species expanded at rates of 100\textendash{}1000 m/yr during the early Holocene. We used chloroplast DNA surveys to show that the geography of postglacial range expansion in two eastern North American tree species differs from that expected from pollen-based reconstructions and from patterns emerging from European molecular studies. Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen. Our estimated rates of œΩ100 m/yr are consistent with model predictions based on life history and dispersal data, and suggest that past migration rates were substantially slower than the rates that will be needed to track 21st-century warming.},

  abstract = {Forests strongly affect Earth's carbon cycles, making our ability to forecast forest-productivity changes associated with rising temperatures and changes in precipitation increasingly critical. In this study, we model the influence of climate on annual radial growth using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees grown for 34 years in a large provenance experiment in western Canada. We use a random-coefficient modeling approach to build universal growth-trend response functions that simultaneously incorporate the impacts of different provenance and site climates on radial growth trends under present and future annual (growth-year), summer, and winter climate regimes. This approach provides new depth to traditional quantitative genetics population response functions by illustrating potential changes in population dominance over time, as well as indicating the age and size at which annual growth begins declining for any population growing in any location under any present or future climate scenario within reason, given the ages and climatic conditions sampled. Our models indicate that lodgepole pine radial-growth levels maximize between 3.9\textdegree{} and 5.1\textdegree{}C mean growth-year temperature. This translates to productivity declining by the mid-21st century in southern and central British Columbia (BC), while increasing beyond the 2080s in northern BC and Yukon, as temperatures rise. Relative to summer climate indices, productivity is predicted to decline continuously through the 2080s in all locations, while relative to winter climate variables, the opposite trend occurs, with the growth increases caused by warmer winters potentially offsetting the summer losses. Trees from warmer provenances, i.e., from the center of the species range, perform best in nearly all of our present and future climate-scenario models. We recommend that similar models be used to analyze population growth trends relative to annual and intra-annual climate in other large-scale provenance trials worldwide. An open-access growth-trend data set encompassing numerous biomes, species, and provenances would contribute substantially to predicting forest productivity under future-climate scenarios.},

  abstract = {A potentially confounding radial-growth interaction exists at the intersection of two well-known principles, one in the field of dendrochronology and the other in quantitative genetics. From a dendrochronology perspective, tree populations growing in climatically marginal environments are expected to be more sensitive to seasonal and annual climate than those growing in optimal climate zones. From a genetics perspective, marginal populations may be adapted to grow a small amount each year and then shut down to prevent climate-induced mortality, or they may be adapted to respond to favourable climate conditions when available. We examined the relative strength of these forces using data from 12 populations of 34-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees growing in 16 provenance-trial sites in western Canada. Growth generally correlated positively with annual temperature and negatively with summer aridity. The sensitivity of radial-growth to interannual climate fluctuations was both site and provenance-related, with the highest sensitivities occurring among populations from warm, central provenances growing at cold, marginal sites, and among populations from cold, marginal provenances growing at warm, central sites. The correlations between climate and growth varied regionally; notably, populations from warm provenances growing at warm sites responded more strongly to summer aridity, while populations from cold provenances growing at warm sites responded more to annual temperature. Our finding that sensitivity varied among populations growing under similar climate conditions indicates that sensitivity is influenced by genetics as well as by site climate, but the regional specificity of the growth responses did not support a single hypothesis for the influence of genetics on growth among populations from marginal vs. central locations. Implications of our study for forest productivity under climate change are more positive for trees growing in cool locations, where overall warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth, than in warm locations, where the negative effects of arid summers may counteract the positive effects of warmer annual temperatures. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The translocation of species into habitable locations outside of their current ranges, termed assisted migration, has been proposed as a means of saving vulnerable species from extinction as a result of climate change. We explore the use of this controversial technique using a threatened keystone species in western North America, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), as a case study. Species distribution models predict that whitebark pine will be extirpated from most of its current range as temperatures rise over the next 70 years. However, the same models indicate that a large area within northwestern British Columbia, Canada, is climatically suitable for the species under current conditions and will remain so throughout the 21st century. To test the capacity of whitebark pine to establish relative to climatic and habitat features within its predicted climatic range, we planted seeds from seven populations in eight locations spanning from 600 km southeast to 800 km northwest of the northern boundary of the current species range. During the first three growing seasons, germination occurred in all locations. Nearly three times as many treated (induced maturation and broken dormancy) than untreated seeds germinated, and most treated seeds germinated a year earlier than the untreated seeds. Germination, survival, and growth were primarily influenced by seed mass, site climate conditions related to the duration of snow cover, and provenance temperature. Our experiment provides a preliminary test of models predicting the existence of climatically suitable whitebark pine habitat north of the current species ranges. More broadly, our techniques and results inform the development of scientific guidelines for assisting the migration of other species that are highly threatened by climate change. Applied case studies of this kind are critical for assessing the utility of species distribution models as conservation planning tools.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genetic structuring, few tools are available to incorporate data on landscape composition into population genetic studies. Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat het-erogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change. The emerging study of how landscape features affect mi-croevolutionary processes (landscape genetics; Manel et al. 2003) will require tools that explicitly incorporate landscape heterogeneity into analyses of gene flow and genetic differ-entiation. Landscape characteristics may modify gene flow between pairs of subpopulations directly by affecting dis-persal rates among them or indirectly by affecting the spatial arrangement of and dispersal rates among intervening sub-populations. Yet, few models are capable of integrating land-scape data into predictions of population structure. For example, models of isolation by distance (Wright 1943) are among the most widely applied tools in studies of genetic differentiation in natural populations. These models have provided powerful means to explain population struc-ture (e.g., Rousset 1997, 2000; Sumner et al. 2001; Rueness et al. 2003), investigate departures from migration-drift equi-librium (Slatkin 1993; Hutchison and Templeton 1999), and address ecological questions such as whether dispersal syn-chronizes the dynamics of populations separated by long dis-tances (Schwartz et al. 2002). Yet, such analyses assume homogeneous, unbounded populations, ignoring effects of range boundaries and of variation in demographic parameters within species' ranges (Maruyama 1970; Slatkin and Maru-yama 1975). As Slatkin (1985) noted, most real populations are neither homogeneous nor unbounded, and when popu-lation densities or migration rates vary across space, the pre-dictive abilities of these models may suffer. Perhaps because of their broad utility, isolation-by-dis-tance models have been a focus of growing efforts to incor-porate landscape data into studies of natural populations. In particular, empiricists now commonly substitute least cost path (LCP) distance measures for Euclidean distances in iso-lation-by-distance analyses (e.g., Arnaud 2003; Coulon et al. 2004; Schweiger et al. 2004; Vignieri 2005). These measures modify geographic distances between sample pairs to account for characteristics of the intervening landscape that facilitate or impede movement along a single, optimal pathway. Yet, despite their intuitive appeal, LCP measures cannot consider the effects of multiple dispersal pathways connecting samples and remain without theoretical foundation for most popula-tion genetic applications. To date, no theoretically justified method to incorporate landscape heterogeneity into isolation-by-distance analyses has been proposed. To address this deficiency, I describe a new method de-signed to predict the effects of landscape structure on equi-librium genetic structuring in natural populations. The iso-lation-by-resistance (IBR) model predicts a positive rela-tionship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a graph theoretic distance metric based in circuit theory. The resistance distance provides a more appropriate predictor of equilibrium genetic differentiation than Euclid-ean distance because it accounts for heterogeneity in species' distributions and migration rates. It improves over LCP meth-ods because it incorporates all possible pathways and is better supported by existing analytic theory. Finally, the resistance distance accommodates a variety of data inputs, from simple habitat or range maps to complex arrays of populations with known sizes and migration rates. Thus, the IBR model fills a gap between models that are nonspatial and those that re-quire heavy parameterization and/or computation, and it pro-vides a quantitative and conceptual link between the disci-plines of population genetics and landscape ecology.},

However, determining which habitats should be set aside to promote connectivity has been difficult because existing models cannot incorporate effects of multiple pathways linking populations. Here, we test an ecological connectivity model that overcomes this obstacle by borrowing from electrical circuit theory. The model vastly improves gene flow predictions because it simultaneously integrates all possible pathways connecting populations. When applied to data from threatened mammal and tree species, the model consistently outperformed conventional gene flow models, revealing that barriers were less important in structuring populations than previously thought. Circuit theory now provides the best-justified method to bridge landscape and genetic data, and holds much promise in ecology, evolution, and conservation planning.},

Data from 13 long-term ({$>$} 1 yr), field-based studies of the effects of elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on European forest tree species were analysed using meta-analysis and modelling. Meta-analysis was used to determine mean responses across the data sets, and data were fitted to two commonly used models of stomatal conductance in order to explore response to environmental conditions and the relationship with assimilation. ? Meta-analysis indicated a significant decrease (21\%) in stomatal conductance in response to growth in elevated [CO2] across all studies. The response to [CO2] was significantly stronger in young trees than old trees, in deciduous compared to coniferous trees, and in water stressed compared to nutrient stressed trees. No evidence of acclimation of stomatal conductance to elevated [CO2] was found. ? Fits of data to the first model showed that growth in elevated [CO2] did not alter the response of stomatal conductance to vapour pressure deficit, soil water content or atmospheric [CO2]. Fits of data to the second model indicated that conductance and assimilation responded in parallel to elevated [CO2] except when water was limiting. ? Data were compared to a previous meta-analysis and it was found that the response of gs to elevated [CO2] was much more consistent in long-term ({$>$} 1 yr) studies, emphasizing the need for long-term elevated [CO2] studies. By interpreting data in terms of models, the synthesis will aid future modelling studies of responses of forest trees to elevated [CO2].},

  abstract = {Aim Species ranges have adapted during the Holocene to altering climate conditions, but it remains unclear if species will be able to keep pace with recent and future climate change. The goal of our study is to assess the influence of changing macroclimate, competition and habitat connectivity on the migration rates of 14 tree species. We also compare the projections of range shifts from species distribution models (SDMs) that incorporate realistic migration rates with classical models that assume no or unlimited migration. Location Europe. Methods We calibrated SDMs with species abundance data from 5768 forest plots from ICP Forest Level 1 in relation to climate, topography, soil and land-use data to predict current and future tree distributions. To predict future species ranges from these models, we applied three migration scenarios: no migration, unlimited migration and realistic migration. The migration rates for the SDMs incorporating realistic migration were estimated according to macroclimate, inter-specific competition and habitat connectivity from simulation experiments with a spatially explicit process model (TreeMig). From these relationships, we then developed a migration cost surface to constrain the predicted distributions of the SDMs. Results The distributions of early-successional species during the 21st century predicted by SDMs that incorporate realistic migration matched quite well with the unlimited migration assumption (mean migration rate over Europe for A1fi/GRAS climate and land-use change scenario 156.7 -\dbend{} 79.1m year -1 and for B1/SEDG 164.3 -\dbend{} 84.2m year -1). The predicted distributions of mid- to late-successional species matched better with the no migration assumption (A1fi/GRAS, 15.2 -\dbend{} 24.5m year -1 and B1/SEDG, 16.0 -\dbend{} 25.6m year -1). Inter-specific competition, which is higher under favourable growing conditions, reduced range shift velocity more than did adverse macroclimatic conditions (i.e. very cold or dry climate). Habitat fragmentation also led to considerable time lags in range shifts. Main conclusions Migration rates depend on species traits, competition, spatial habitat configuration and climatic conditions. As a result, re-adjustments of species ranges to climate and land-use change are complex and very individualistic, yet still quite predictable. Early-successional species track climate change almost instantaneously while mid- to late- successional species were predicted to migrate very slowly. -\dbend{} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

  abstract = {Although FST is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F{${'}$}ST and D. F{${'}$}ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, F{${'}$}ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4~years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F{${'}$}ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased F{${'}$}ST estimator based on GST, which we call G{${'}{'}$}ST. However, F{${'}$}ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F{${'}$}ST or D. In most cases, F{${'}$}ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

The most extreme low-frequency feature of the new reconstruction, covering A.D. 762-2005, is a hydrologic drought in the mid-1100s. The drought is characterized by a decrease of more than 15\% in mean annual flow averaged over 25 years, and by the absence of high annual flows over a longer period of about six decades. The drought is consistent in timing with dry conditions inferred from tree-ring data in the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, but regional differences in intensity emphasize the importance of basin-specific paleoclimatic data in quantifying likely effects of drought on water supply.},

In this integrodifference model, competition betweenconspecifics takes the form of a quasi-local interaction, where the strength ofcompetition between two individuals depends on their physical distance fromeach other. Both the deterministic model and a stochastic analogue are examinedby numerically simulating the spread of a localized initial population overseveral generations. By modelling intraspecific competition with a quasi-localinteraction, the shape of the travelling waves changed significantly from that ofthe classical model with only local competition, creating more variable and complexwavefront shapes than are possible with the classical model. The addition ofquasi-local competition was also found to alter several aspects of the initial behaviourof this model, including the invasion speed and spatial structure, althoughin the deterministic case the asymptotic invasion speed and population densitybehind the front of the wave agreed with those of the classical model. In thestochastic analogue, however, the rate of spread of the invasion was found to beconsiderably lower than that of the classical model, both initially and asymptotically.Furthermore, the speed achieved by the stochastic invasions was found todepend on the parameters of the quasi-local interaction kernel.},

In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data. We argue that soft sweeps might be the dominant mode of adaptation in many species. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, for many tree species, annual survival of most individuals is high, so that mortality is rare and, therefore, difficult to estimate. Furthermore, tree mortality models have potentially complex suites of covariates. Here, we extend traditional and recent approaches to modeling tree mortality and propose a new non-parametric Bayesian method. Our model is constrained to both reflect and distinguish known relationships between mortality and its two key covariates, diameter and diameter increment growth, but it remains sufficiently flexible to capture a wide variety of patterns of mortality across these covariates. Our model also allows incorporation of outside information in the form of priors, so that increased mortality of large trees can always be formally modeled even when data are sparse. We present results for our nonparametric Bayesian mortality model for maple (Acer spp.), holly (Ilex spp.), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.), and tulip-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) populations from North Carolina, USA.},

Human communities and needs are nested within landscapes formed by interactions among the hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. Understanding the complex processes that shape landscapes and deriving ways to manage them sustainably while meeting human needs require sophisticated modeling and monitoring. The long-term goals of the ILM are to 1. Identify, evaluate, and validate system components that are indicators of landscape change; 2. Provide feedback to land managers on the results of management actions in the context of ecosystem change through synthesis of data, models, and other decision support tools; 3. Define the unique ability of USGS to respond to customer needs in the area of landscape monitoring; and 4. Lay out a vision for the future that will make use of USGS capabilities to design and implement monitoring networks, understand and model ecosystem change, and forecast landscape change. The Great Basin was selected as one of four national pilot landscape areas for integrated landscape monitoring effort because (1) there is a well-defined need by Federal, State, and local community groups for monitoring and ecosystem understanding at the landscape scale; and (2) USGS has significant capability, ongoing work, robust partnerships, and regional datasets in place. In response to the national directive, the Great Basin Integrated Landscape Monitoring Project (GBILM) was formed with participation from the five USGS disciplines and several Department of Interior partner agencies.

Brasher Chapter 1. Conceptual Models for Landscape Monitoring By D.M. Miller, S.P. Finn, Andrea Woodward, and Alicia Torregrosa In this document, we summarize and organize current understanding of ecosystem structure and function in the Great Basin using conceptual models. Communicating this understanding is fundamental to developing monitoring programs and can be done with clarity using the pictorial format of conceptual models. Conceptual models are not ends in themselves but are helpful organizers of thought, information, and ideas, and represent tools for communication and inquiry among scientists, managers, and the interested public. Consequently, the conceptual models in this report can be thought of as maps or flowcharts that help navigate a progression of scientific thought that starts with determining key ecological components and ends with a summary of mechanisms for the causal influences and relations among them. Eventually, conceptual models can provide a structure for designing monitoring programs, interpreting monitoring and other data, and assessing the accuracy of our understanding of ecosystem functions and processes. Additionally, the models can guide the identification of a few important attributes that provide information about multiple aspects of ecosystem status (Noon, 2003) and are efficient indicators to monitor.},

  abstract = {Fossil pollen records suggest rapid migration of tree species in response to Quaternary climate warming. Long-distance dispersal and high gene flow would facilitate rapid migration, but would initially homogenize variation among populations. However, contemporary clinal variation in adaptive traits along environmental gradients shown in many tree species suggests that local adaptation can occur during rapid migration over just a few generations in interglacial periods. In this study, we compared growth performance and pollen genetic structure among populations to investigate how populations of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) have responded to local selection along the historical migration route. The results suggest strong adaptive divergence among populations (average Q(ST)=0.61), corresponding to climatic gradients. The population genetic structure, determined by microsatellite markers (R(ST)=0.09; F(ST)=0.11), was higher than previous estimates from less polymorphic genetic markers. The significant correlation between geographic and pollen haplotype genetic (R(ST)) distances (r=0.73, P{$<$}0.01) indicates that the current genetic structure has been shaped by isolation-by-distance, and has developed in relatively few generations. This suggests relatively limited gene flow among populations on a recent timescale. Gene flow from neighboring populations may have provided genetic diversity to founder populations during rapid migration in the early stages of range expansion. Increased genetic diversity subsequently enhanced the efficiency of local selection, limiting gene flow primarily to among similar environments and facilitating the evolution of adaptive clinal variation along environmental gradients.},

The importance of peripheral populations to conservation and evolution is controversial, and additional information about their genetic structure and evolutionary dynamics will inform conservation strategies. In wind-pollinated species, selfing rate is generally negatively correlated with population size and density, and inbreeding may therefore increase toward range peripheries. Picea sitchensis has a long and narrow range along the Pacific Coast of North America that tapers toward the northern and southern peripheries. We investigated whether central and peripheral populations differ in mating system parameters. The results suggest that population position within the range has a strong effect on mating system, and geographic isolation appears to be associated with higher selfing. The estimated effective number of pollen donors was much higher in the center of the range (mean = 18.5) than at the periphery (mean = 3.6), while selfing rate increased from 7.3\% in central populations to as high as 35.2\% in the northern, isolated population. These strong geographical patterns suggest mating system is influenced by both population size and isolation at range peripheries.},

Bud phenology exhibited parallel reaction norms among populations; however, putatively adaptive plasticity and strong divergent selection were seen in bud burst and bud set timing respectively.

  abstract = {While habitat fragmentation is a central issue in forest conservation studies in the face of broad-scale anthropogenic changes to the environment, its effects on contemporary mating patterns remain controversial. This is partly because of the inherent variation in mating patterns which may exist within species and the fact that few studies have replication at the landscape level. To study the effect of forest fragmentation on contemporary mating patterns, including effective pollen dispersal, we compared four native populations of the Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. We used six microsatellite markers to genotype 1289 open-pollinated offspring from paired fragmented and continuous populations on the island of Tasmania and in Victoria on mainland Australia. The mating patterns in the two continuous populations were similar, despite large differences in population density. In contrast, the two fragmented populations were variable and idiosyncratic in their mating patterns, particularly in their pollen dispersal kernels. The continuous populations showed relatively high outcrossing rates (86-89\%) and low correlated paternity (0.03-0.06) compared with the fragmented populations (65-79\% and 0.12-0.20 respectively). A greater proportion of trees contributed to reproduction in the fragmented (de/d{$>$}or= 0.5) compared with the continuous populations (de/d = 0.03-0.04). Despite significant inbreeding in the offspring of the fragmented populations, there was little evidence of loss of genetic diversity. It is argued that enhanced medium- and long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes may act to partly buffer the remnant populations from the negative effects of inbreeding and drift.},

  abstract = {Most current models of assimilate carbohydrate partitioning are based on growth patterns observed under a range of experimental conditions, from which a set of empirical rules are derived to simulate partitioning. As a result, they are not good at extrapolating to other conditions; this requires a mechanistic approach, which only transport-resistance (TR) models currently provide. We examine an approach to incorporating recent progress in phloem physiology into the TR approach, which leads to a 'minimalist' Munch model of a branched system with competing sinks. In vivo whole-plant measurements have demonstrated that C-flow rates are dependent not only on the properties of the sink, but also on the properties of the whole transport system, and the detailed dynamics of this behaviour is mimicked by the proposed model. This model provides a sound theoretical framework for an unambiguous definition of sink and source strengths, with sink priority being an emergent property of the model. Further developments are proposed, some of which have already had limited application, to cope with the complexity of plants; the emphasis is on a modular approach, together with the importance of choosing the appropriate scale level for both structure and function. Whole-plant experiments with in vivo measurement of the phloem dynamics will be needed to help with this choice.},

  abstract = {A database of monthly climate observations from meteorological stations is constructed. The database includes six climate elements and extends over the global land surface. The database is checked for inhomogeneities in the station records using an automated method that refines previous methods by using incomplete and partially overlapping records and by detecting inhomogeneities with opposite signs in different seasons. The method includes the development of reference series using neighbouring stations. Information from different sources about a single station may be combined, even without an overlapping period, using a reference series. Thus, a longer station record may be obtained and fragmentation of records reduced. The reference series also enables 1961\textendash{}90 normals to be calculated for a larger proportion of stations. The station anomalies are interpolated onto a 0.5\textdegree{} grid covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) and combined with a published normal from 1961\textendash{}90.

  abstract = {The problem of scale has been a critical impediment to incorporating important fine-scale processes into global ecosystem models. Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a sizeand age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15\cyrchar\CYRNJE{} N to 15\cyrchar\CYRNJE{} S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.},

We measured the basal area of rapidly growing Pinus taeda trees exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment for 8 years and used these measurements to estimate monthly and annual growth. We used these measurements in a statistical model to estimate the start and end of growth in each year. Elevated CO2 increased the basal area increment (BAI) of trees by 13-27\%. In most years, exposure to elevated CO2 increased the growth rate but not the duration of the active growth period. With the exception of 1 year following an extreme drought and a severe ice storm, BAI was positively correlated with the amount of rainfall during the active growth period. The interannual variation in the relative enhancement of BAI caused by elevated CO2 was strongly related to temperature and rainfall, and was greatest in years with high vapor pressure deficit. There was no evidence of a systematic reduction in the stimulation of growth during the first 8 years of this experiment, suggesting that the hypothesized limitation of the CO2 response caused by nitrogen availability has yet to occur.},

  abstract = {Low-latitudinal range margins of temperate and boreal plant species typically consist of scattered populations that persist locally in microrefugia. It remains poorly understood how their refugial habitats affect patterns of gene flow and connectivity, key components for their long-term viability and evolution. We examine landscape-scale patterns of historical and contemporary gene flow in refugial populations of the widespread European forest tree Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) at the species' southwestern range margin. We sampled all adult trees (n = 135) growing in a 20 km long valley and genotyped 724 acorns from 72 mother trees at 17 microsatellite loci. The ten oak stands that we identified were highly differentiated and formed four distinct genetic clusters, despite sporadic historical dispersal being detectable. By far most contemporary pollination occurred within stands, either between local mates (85.6\%) or through selfing (6.8\%). Pollen exchange between stands (2.6\%) was remarkably rare given their relative proximity and was complemented by long-distance pollen immigration (4.4\%) and hybridization with the locally abundant Quercus pyrenaica (0.6\%). The frequency of between-stand mating events decreased with increasing size and spatial isolation of stands. Overall, our results reveal outstandingly little long-distance gene flow for a wind-pollinated tree species. We argue that the distinct landscape characteristics of oaks' refugial habitats, with a combination of a rugged topography, dense vegetation and humid microclimate, are likely to increase plant survival but to hamper effective long-distance pollen dispersal. Moreover, local mating might be favoured by high tree compatibility resulting from genetic purging in these long-term relict populations. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {Many studies have examined the impact of dispersal on local adaptation, but much less attention has been paid to how local adaptation influences range shifts. The aim of this study was to test how local adaptation might affect climate-driven range shifts in plants, and if this might differ between plants with different life histories. Simulated range shift dynamics were compared for hypothetical annual, perennial, and tree species, each comprised of either one plastic genotype or 6 locally adapted genotypes. The landscape consists of shifting climate bands made up of 20 x 20 m patches t containing multiple individuals. Effects of seed dispersal, breadth of the plastic species' tolerance, steepness of the climate gradient, and rate of the climate shift are also examined. Local adaptation ip increased the equilibrium range size and aided range shifts by boosting fitness near range edges. r However, when the rate of climate change was doubled on a steep gradient, locally-adapted trees c exhibited a higher percent loss of range during the climate shift. The plastic annual species with s short dispersal was unable to recover its range size even after the climate stabilized, while the locally u adapted annuals tracked climate change well. The results suggest that in most situations local n adaptation and longer dispersal distances will be advantageous, though not necessarily sufficient, for a tracking suitable climates. However, local adaptation might put species with long generation times at greater risk when climate shifts are very rapid. If confirmed by empirical tests, these results M suggest that identifying variation between species in how fitness varies along climate gradients and in these key demographic rates might aid in prioritizing management actions.},

Weather conditions act as cues influencing reproduction of individual plants, and similar responses expressed across many individuals lead to population-level synchrony in reproductive output. In turn, synchrony leads to benefits from economies of scale such as enhanced pollination success and seed predator satiation. However, there may also be individual-level benefits from reproductive responses to weather cues, which may explain the origin of masting in the absence of economies of scale. In a previous study, we found support for a mechanism whereby individual responses to weather cues attenuate the negative autocorrelation between past and current annual seed production\textemdash{}a pattern typically attributed to resource limitation and reproductive tradeoffs among years. Methods Here we provide a follow-up and more robust evaluation of this hypothesis in 12 species of oaks (Quercus spp.), testing for a negative autocorrelation (tradeoff) between past and current reproduction and whether responses to weather cues associated with masting reduce the strength of this negative autocorrelation. Key Results Our results showed a strong negative autocorrelation for 11 of the species, and that species-specific reproductive responses to weather cues dampened this negative autocorrelation in 10 of them. Conclusions This dampening effect presumably reflects a reduction in resource limitation or increased resource use associated with weather conditions, and suggests that responses to weather cues conferring these advantages should be selected for based on individual benefits.},

  abstract = {A hypothesis has been advanced that the incursion of woody plants into world grasslands over the past two centuries has been driven in part by increasing carbon dioxide concentration, [CO(2)], in Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the warm season forage grasses they are displacing, woody plants have a photosynthetic metabolism and carbon allocation patterns that are responsive to CO(2), and many have tap roots that are more effective than grasses for reaching deep soil water stores that can be enhanced under elevated CO(2). However, this commonly cited hypothesis has little direct support from manipulative experimentation and competes with more traditional theories of shrub encroachment involving climate change, management, and fire. Here, we show that, although doubling [CO(2)] over the Colorado shortgrass steppe had little impact on plant species diversity, it resulted in an increasingly dissimilar plant community over the 5-year experiment compared with plots maintained at present-day [CO(2)]. Growth at the doubled [CO(2)] resulted in an approximately 40-fold increase in aboveground biomass and a 20-fold increase in plant cover of Artemisia frigida Willd, a common subshrub of some North American and Asian grasslands. This CO(2)-induced enhancement of plant growth, among the highest yet reported, provides evidence from a native grassland suggesting that rising atmospheric [CO(2)] may be contributing to the shrubland expansions of the past 200 years. Encroachment of shrubs into grasslands is an important problem facing rangeland managers and ranchers; this process replaces grasses, the preferred forage of domestic livestock, with species that are unsuitable for domestic livestock grazing.},

First, we discuss the benefits and challenges of using aerial photographs for ecological management.

The primary objectives were to investigate the potential exposures of occupants and their pet dogs to diazinon after an application to turf at their residences and to determine if personal contacts between occupants and their pet dogs resulted in measurable exposures. It was conducted from April to August 2001 before the Agency phased out all residential uses of diazinon in December 2004. Six families and their pet dogs were recruited into the study. Monitoring was conducted at pre-, 1, 2, 4, and 8 days post-application of a commercial, granular formulation of diazinon to the lawn by the homeowner. Environmental samples collected included soil, indoor air, carpet dust, and transferable residues from lawns and floors. Samples collected from the pet dogs consisted of paw wipes, fur clippings, and transferable residues from the fur by a technician or child wearing a cotton glove(s). First morning void (FMV) urine samples were collected from each child and his/her parent on each sampling day. Diazinon was analyzed in all samples, except urine, by GC-MS. The metabolite 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPy) was analyzed in the urine samples by HPLC-MS/MS. Mean airborne residues of diazinon on day 1 postapplication were at least six times higher in both the living rooms (2357267 ng/m3) and children's bedrooms (1797246 ng/m3) than at pre-application. Mean loadings of diazinon in carpet dust samples were at least 20 times greater on days 2, 4, and 8 post-application than mean loadings (0.0370.04 ng/cm2) at pre-application. The pet dogs had over 900 times higher mean loadings of diazinon residues on their paws on day 1 post-application (88.17100.1 ng/cm2) compared to mean loadings (o0.09 ng/cm2) at pre-application. The mean diazinon loadings on the fur clippings were at least 14 times higher on days 1, 2, 4, and 8 post-application than mean loadings (0.870.4 ng/cm2) at pre-application. For transferable residues from dog fur, the mean loadings of diazinon on the technician's cotton glove samples were the lowest before application (0.0470.08 ng/cm2) and the highest on day 1 post-application (10.4723.9 ng/cm2) of diazinon to turf. Urinary IMPy concentrations for the participants ranged from o0.3 to 5.5 ng/mL before application and o0.3\textendash{}12.5 ng/mL after application of diazinon. The mean urinary IMPy concentrations for children or adults were not statistically different (p40.05) at pre-application compared to post-application of diazinon to turf. The results showed that the participants and their pet dogs were likely exposed to low levels of diazinon residues from several sources (i.e., air, dust, and soil), through several pathways and routes, after lawn applications at these residences. Lastly, the pet dog appears to be an important pathway for the transfer and translocation of diazinon residues inside the homes and likely exposed occupants through personal contacts (i.e., petting).},

Our aim here is to demonstrate that the sensitivity of such models to climate input characteristics may complicate their validation and introduce uncertainties in their predictions. In this study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of a process-based tree distribution model PHENOFIT to climate input characteristics. This analysis was conducted for two North American trees which differ greatly in their distribution and eight different types of climate input for the historic period which differ in their spatial (local or gridded data) and temporal (daily vs. monthly) resolution as well as their type (locally recorded, extrapolated or simulated by General Circulation Models). We show that the climate data resolution (spatial and temporal) and their type, highly affect the model predictions. The sensitivity analysis also revealed, the importance, for global climate change impact assessment, of (i) the daily variability of temperatures in modeling the biological processes shaping species distribution, (ii) climate data at high latitudes and elevations and (iii) climate data with high spatial resolution.},

Here we used a process-based model to identify these processes and to assess the potential distribution of 17 North American boreal/temperate tree species. Using input of only climate and soil properties, the model reproduced the 17 species' distributions accurately. Our results allowed us to identify the climatic factors as well as the biological processes involved in limiting species' ranges. The model showed that climatic constraints limit species' distributions mainly through their impact on phenological processes, and secondarily through their impact on drought and frost mortality. The northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit ripening and/or flowering, while the southern limit is caused by the inability to flower or by frost injury to flowers. These findings about the ecological processes shaping tree species' distribution represent a crucial step toward obtaining a more complete picture of the potential impact of climate on species' ranges.},

We compared observed range sizes, measured in either one (latitudinal or longitudinal extent) or two dimensions (range area), with three null models that respected constraints imposed by the geometry of the continent; we tested whether climatic gradients could account for increasing range size with latitude - a Rapoport effect - in North American trees; and whether variation in range size was associated with phylogeny or ecological characteristics of species. We documented an excess of species with small ranges and a lack of widely distributed species compared with null expectations both with and without environmental constraints. We found evidence for a Rapoport effect in North American trees, at different taxonomic levels and for different groups defined by ecological characteristics. This pattern is not an outcome constrained by continental shape and does not depend on the metric for range size, but it is consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis proposed to explain the Rapoport pattern. Finally we showed that trees east of the Rocky Mountains have larger ranges on average than trees to the west or in Mexico and that the proportion of deciduous compared to evergreen species increases with range size. Variation in range size among North American trees is not spatially random, and has a phylogenetic and ecological signal. Consistent with the climatic variability hypothesis, range size of North American trees increases with increasing variability in annual temperature range at higher latitudes.},

  abstract = {In temperate zones, trees tend to unfold their leaves earlier due to climate warming. However, changes in the timing of the bud development also affect the dynamics of the cold-hardening process, which may increase frost injuries endured by trees because new leaves unfold at a period when frost events can still occur. This possible increase in frost damage in response to climate change is known as the "frost-damage hypothesis". In this study, we have tested this hypothesis by forcing a process-based frost-injury model with process-based phenological models for 22 North American species with two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change storylines. Using a simplified parameterization of the frost-injury model, we found that risk of frost injury changed with climate change for all species. In fact, frost injury decreased for the vast majority of the species, but this trend varied across species and throughout each species' distribution. We further explored the variability of response among species using their phenological and geographic characteristics. The interspecific trends depicted here show what could be the implications of climate change on the ecophysiology of boreal and temperate trees and highlight the importance of process-based models in studying the complexity of long-term impacts of climate change on species biology.},

Unfortunately, the patchiness of data that poses challenges for today's historical ecologist may be similarly problematic for those in the future seeking to understand what are currently present-day conditions and trends, in part because of societal underinvestment in systematic collection and curation. We therefore highlight the generational imperative that contemporary scientists and managers individually have \textendash{} especially in this era of tremendous global change \textendash{} to ensure sufficient documentation of the past and current conditions of the places and resources to which they have access. Although historical records have proved invaluable in addressing myriad societal challenges, societal investment in systematic collection and curation is widely recognized to be insufficient. Such underinvestment creates gaps in data that will limit the ability of future historical ecologists to understand present-day conditions and trends, which is especially unfortunate given the degree of global change currently under way. Individual scientists, resource managers, and citizen scientists can play a critical role in filling the gap, by taking the initiative to sample and archive the contemporary conditions of the places and resources to which they have access. A crowdsourced initiative can be instrumental in generating the records needed to inform a wide array of current and future societal interests, including biodiversity conservation.},

These compounds may be preformed inhibitors that are present constitutively in healthy plants (also known as phytoanticipins), or they may be synthesized in response to pathogen attack (phytoalexins). Successful pathogens must be able to circumvent or overcome these antifungal defenses, and this review focuses on the significance of fungal resistance to plant antibiotics as a mechanism of pathogenesis. There is increasing evidence that resistance of fungal pathogens to plant antibiotics can be important for pathogenicity, at least for some fungus-plant interactions. This evidence has emerged largely from studies of fungal degradative enzymes and also from experiments in which plants with altered levels of antifungal secondary metabolites were generated. Whereas the emphasis to date has been on degradative mechanisms of resistance of phytopathogenic fungi to antifungal secondary metabolites, in the future we are likely to see a rapid expansion in our knowledge of alternative mechanisms of resistance. These may include membrane efflux systems of the kind associated with multidrug resistance and innate resistance due to insensitivity of the target site. The manipulation of plant biosynthetic pathways to give altered antibiotic profiles will also be valuable in telling us more about the significance of antifungal secondary metabolites for plant defense and clearly has great potential for enhancing disease resistance for commercial purposes.},

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

Over the last decade, the south-western US has experienced six drought years, including the extreme droughts of 1996 and 2002, which led to widespread tree mortality across northern Arizona. 2 We examined the impact of these droughts on the co-dominant tree species of the pinyon-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma), a major vegetation type in the US. 3 Pinyon mortality following both droughts was 6.5-fold higher than juniper mortality. In addition, large pinyons suffered 2-6-fold greater mortality than small pinyons, a pattern associated with higher mortality of reproductively mature trees and survival of smaller pinyons resulting from facilitation by established vegetation. Differential mortality of large pinyons resulted in a vegetation shift such that the pinyon-juniper woodlands are becoming dominated by juniper, a species that is typical of lower elevations and more arid conditions. 4 Sites that experienced high pinyon mortality during the first drought suffered additional mortality during the second drought, so that reductions in tree densities and the resulting release from below-ground competition did not buffer surviving pinyons against additional mortality during the second drought. Such repeated mortality events also suggest that these stands may suffer chronic stress. 5 Reductions in biotic associations (e.g. avian seed dispersers, ectomycorrhizas and nurse plants) that will probably result from extreme mortality of large pinyons ensure that the observed vegetation shifts will be persistent. Because approximately 1000 species are associated with pinyon pine, the shift in the structure of these woodlands has large-scale community consequences.},

  abstract = {Explaining functional connectivity among occupied habitats is crucial for understanding metapopulation dynamics and species ecology. Landscape genetics has primarily focused on elucidating how ecological features between observations influence gene flow. Functional connectivity, however, may be the result of both these between-site (landscape resistance) landscape characteristics and at-site (patch quality) landscape processes that can be captured using network based models. We test hypotheses of functional connectivity that include both between-site and at-site landscape processes in metapopulations of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) by employing a novel justification of gravity models for landscape genetics (eight microsatellite loci, 37 sites, n = 441). Primarily used in transportation and economic geography, gravity models are a unique approach as flow (e.g. gene flow) is explained as a function of three basic components: distance between sites, production/attraction (e.g. at-site landscape process) and resistance (e.g. between-site landscape process). The study system contains a network of nutrient poor high mountain lakes where we hypothesized a short growing season and complex topography between sites limit R. luteiventris gene flow. In addition, we hypothesized production of offspring is limited by breeding site characteristics such as the introduction of predatory fish and inherent site productivity. We found that R. luteiventris connectivity was negatively correlated with distance between sites, presence of predatory fish (at-site) and topographic complexity (between-site). Conversely, site productivity (as measured by heat load index, at-site) and growing season (as measured by frost-free period between-sites) were positively correlated with gene flow. The negative effect of predation and positive effect of site productivity, in concert with bottleneck tests, support the presence of source\textendash{}sink dynamics. In conclusion, gravity models provide a powerful new modelling approach for examining a wide range of both basic and applied questions in landscape genetics.},

  abstract = {Cones are harvested from Mediterranean Stone pine Pinus pinea L. for their edible kernels, pine nuts, which have been used as a food item in the region since Palaeolithic times. At present, cone yields render higher incomes to the owners of these pine forests than any other forest product. The large annual variation of cone yields is an important issue for forest management planning, which requires further research in order to establish its causes. One of the simplest explanations given for masting habits in polycarpic plants is that of weather tracking. Many plant ecologists, however, consider that this theory is insufficient and that further causes should be investigated. In this context, the present study analyses historical weather and yield registers over 41 years in one of the world's main Stone pine areas, the Northern Inland Plateau of Spain. Significant relationships found between rainfall and temperatures at certain key periods during the 4-year cone development period allowed for a multiple linear regression model for the log-transformed annual cone yield to be set up. This also included a negative autocorrelation with the ripening cone load during strobili induction. The model accounts for 75\% of total variance between years. The observed trend of cone-yield reduction from 180 to less than 100 kg ha-1in the last 40 years was slightly overestimated by the predicted effects of the covariables that show significant tendencies to a warmer and drier climate. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The relevance of environmental influence on growth and flower regulation in Mediterranean stone pine as nut crop is stressed. Different models of thermal time compute were compared for characterizing phenostage onset, shoot and cone growth response to temperature. Non-linear regression models for relative length of preformed shoots and relative cone diameter were fitted in thermal-time scale. Shoot-growth timing was characterized by a common degree-day sum between years. Correlation of June rainfall with shoot length and flower bearing in the next year and with current needle and branch diameter growth was highly significant. Also, summer shoots and a second female flowering occurred occasionally in leader branches in dependence on June rainfall, but cone-setting failed due to the absence of pollen.

We investigated the influence of two physiographic landscapes on population structure and postglacial colonization of two white pine species of contrasting habitats: P. monticola, which occurs in the highly mountainous region of western North America, and P. strobus, which occurs in a much less mountainous area in eastern North America.\textbullet\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: To characterize the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure across the ranges of both species, 158 and 153 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from expressed genes were genotyped on range-wide samples of 61 P. monticola and 133 P. strobus populations, respectively.\textbullet\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nKEY RESULTS: In P. monticola, a steep latitudinal decrease in genetic diversity likely resulted from postglacial colonization involving rare long-distance dispersal (LDD) events. In contrast, no geographic patterns of diversity were detected in P. strobus, suggesting recolonization via a gradually advancing front or frequent LDD events. For each species, structure analyses identified two distinct southern and northern genetic groups that likely originated from two different glacial lineages. At a finer scale, and for the two species, smaller subgroups were detected that could be remnants of cryptic refugia.\textbullet\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSION: During postglacial colonization, the western and eastern North American landscapes had different impacts on genetic signatures in P. monticola compared with P. strobus. We discuss the importance of our findings for conservation programs and predictions of species' response to climate change.},

Subspecies performance in each site was measured in four ways: probability of seedling emergence, early vegetative size (length of longest leaf), probability of flowering, and total numberof inflorescences producedper plant. Analysis of three of the four variablesdemonstratedlocal adaptation through site-by-subspecies interactions in which natives outperformedimmigrants.The disparitybetween natives and immigrants in their probability of emergence and probability of flowering was greater at the coastal site than at the inland site. Treatedin isolation, these two fitness components suggest that migration from the coast to the inland site may be less restricted by selection than migration in the opposite direction. Two measurements of individual size (leaf length and number of inflorescences), suggest (though not strongly) that immigrants may be subject to weaker selection at the coastal site than at the inland site. A standardcohort life table is used to compare replacement rates (RO)for each subspecies at each site. Comparisons of Ros suggest that immigrants are under a severe demographic disadvantage at the coastal site, but only a small disadvantage at the inland site. The results point out the importance of integrating over several fitness components when documenting the magnitude of local adaptation.},

We found that the greater the match between the surface chemistry of Maculinea alcon and two of its host Myrmica species, the more easily ant colonies were exploited. The geographic patterns of surface chemistry indicate an ongoing coevolutionary arms race between the butterflies and Myrmica rubra, which has significant genetic differentiation between populations, but not between the butterflies and a second, sympatric host, Myrmica ruginodis, which has panmictic populations. Alternative hosts may therefore provide an evolutionary refuge for a parasite during periods of counteradaptation by their preferred hosts.},

The current surge of renewed interest in LDD, motivated by growing recognition of its critical importance for natural populations and communities and for humanity, promises an improved, quantitatively derived understanding of LDD. To gain deep insights into the patterns, mechanisms, causes, and consequences of LDD, we must look beyond the standard dispersal vectors and the mean trend of the distribution of dispersal distances. "Nonstandard" mechanisms such as extreme climatic events and generalized LDD vectors seem to hold the greatest explanatory power for the drastic deviations from the mean trend, deviations that make the nearly impossible LDD a reality.},

LDD is often associated with unusual behavior of the standard vector inferred from plant dispersal morphology, or mediated by nonstandard vectors. To advance our understanding of LDD, we advocate a vector-based research approach that identifies the significant LDD vectors and quantifies how environmental conditions modify their actions. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We modelled the spread of North American wind-dispersed trees in current and future (c. 2060) conditions, accounting for variation in 10 key dispersal, demographic and environmental factors affecting population spread. Predicted spread rates vary substantially among 12 study species, primarily due to inter-specific variation in maturation age, fecundity and seed terminal velocity. Future spread is predicted to be faster if atmospheric CO(2) enrichment would increase fecundity and advance maturation, irrespective of the projected changes in mean surface windspeed. Yet, for only a few species, predicted wind-driven spread will match future climate changes, conditioned on seed abscission occurring only in strong winds and environmental conditions favouring high survival of the farthest-dispersed seeds. Because such conditions are unlikely, North American wind-dispersed trees are expected to lag behind the projected climate range shift.},

  abstract = {A causal relationship between Holocene patterns of plant distributions in the American Southwest and shifts in atmospheric flow structure has been inferred, but has yet to be demonstrated. To investigate this inferred relationship, seedlings of Quercus gambelii were transplanted along various local microhabitat gradients and regional air mass gradients and assessed for patterns of seedling establishment. The primary cause of seedling mortality appeared to be summer drought stress, which paralleled the latitudinal gradient of the `Arizona monsoon'. The `Arizona monsoon' air mass gradient produces an increasing probability of summer drought stress with increasing latitude, while the `polar front' air mass gradient produces an increasing probability of winter and spring cold stress with increasing latitude. We hypothesize that the two gradients produce, as a function of increasing latitude, convergent upper and lower elevational limits of Q. gambelii. The results of this elevational convergence appear to be a virtual absence of oak seedling establishment near the species' northern limits and a gradual senescence of long-lived clones from spring freeze stress when followed by summer drought stress. These conclusions have been extended to the biogeography of Q. turbinella through growth chamber experiments on the comparative drought physiology of seedlings of the two species and through previous work on their associated biogeographic patterns. Thus, the northern ecotones of Q. gambelii and Q. turbinella, appear to be primarily caused by the combination of spring freeze stress and summer moisture stress, rather than freeze stress alone, as previously proposed. We report systematic temporal and spatial shifts in the two air mass gradients, between warming and cooling trends, which can account for the Holocene biogeographic history of the two oak species and, in part, the observed spatial and temporal variations in oak morphology and oak/pine community structure.},

  abstract = {The saguaro (Cereus giganteus, Carnegiea gigantea) a giant cactus, is a conspicuous and important plant of the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona and northern Mexico (Sonora). Since the turn of the century it has been known to be failing to reproduce in certain environments ( 1 ) . This failure has stimulated considerable research on various aspects of its biology ( 2 ) . Decline in reproduction dates from the rapid growth of the cattle industry in the 1880's, an influence which has left a lasting imprint on parts of the Southwest. The aim of this article is to combine the knowledge of saguaro biology with the authors' population data from the Santa Catalina Mountains and adjacent ranges in a discussion of saguaro as a natural population in relation to environment and disturbance. The influence of climate, soils, overgrazing, and heavy rodent populations is considered in relation to saguaro survival ( 3 ) .},

  abstract = {Variation in thermal constraints on activity has been hypothesized to be an important ecological source of geographic variation in growth rates of juvenile eastern fence lizards Sceloporus undulatus. However, most of the evidence to support this hypothesis is either inferential or indirect. In this study, I quantitatively compared thermal constraints on activity and their relationship to growth rates of free-ranging juvenile fence lizards from two extremes of the range of variation in growth rate (Nebraska and New Jersey) used in a reciprocal transplant experiment. I also examined energy allocation made to growth and storage by yearling lizards. Reduced growth rates in New Jersey of normally fast-growing hatchlings from Nebraska were associated with a more stringent thermal constraint on activity corresponding to a 2\textendash{}3-h shorter predicted daily activity period in New Jersey compared to Nebraska. The thermal constraint on activity was particularly strong (24\% less time available in New Jersey compared to Nebraska) during the period when hatchling lizards emerge (August\textendash{}October). An 8\% reduction in total activity time available over the course of a single year was associated with a 7\% reduction in the total amount of energy accumulated by lizards in New Jersey. Differences in the total amount of energy available for allocation were also accompanied by differences in how energy was allocated. Lizards from New Jersey had an allocatable energy pool of approximately 40.34 kJ (88\% to growth, 12\% to storage, and 0\% to reproduction). Lizards from Nebraska had an allocatable pool of 43.44 kJ (22\% to growth, 18\% to storage, and 60\% to reproduction). This study joins others in advocating and illustrating an integrative approach to determining the causes and consequences of life-history variation by combining experimental, comparative, and phylogenetic methods in a single system.},

In New Zealand many canopy trees are slow-growing and long-lived, and have extremely narrow rings. Single rings or groups of rings may be absent on some radii. Such narrow and absent rings cause difficulties in ring counting and necessitate careful sample preparation. The errors associated with age estimates derived from cores which do not reach the chronological centre of the tree (partial cores) are discussed. Four partial core lengths and three methods of estima- tion were used on cross-sections of known age from Agathzs australis, Libocedrus bidwillll, Nothofagus solandri, and Prumnopitys taxifolia. It is concluded that mean errors may be less than + 10\% where the core length represents 90\% of the geometric radius (half the measured diameter) but increase with shorter cores. However, much greater errors may apply to individual estimates, up to + 78\% in one case. Moreover, the direction of the error (above or below the true value) is largely depend- ent upon the early growth conditions and is unpre- dictable. These errors appear to occur for three main reasons: eccentric growth, age dependent growth variations, and other growth variations.},

The fossil record suggests that recovery of global ecosystems has required millions or even tens of millions of years. Thus, intervention by humans, the very agents of the current environmental crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery or maintenance of the biota. Many current recovery efforts have deficiencies, including insufficient information on the diversity and distribution of species, ecological processes, and magnitude and interaction of threats to biodiversity (pollution, overharvesting, climate change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, introduced or invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation through land use, disruption of community structure in habitats, and others). A much greater and more urgently applied investment to address these deficiencies is obviously warranted. Conservation and restoration in human-dominated ecosystems must strengthen connections between human activities, such as agricultural or harvesting practices, and relevant research generated in the biological, earth, and atmospheric sciences. Certain threats to biodiversity require intensive international cooperation and input from the scientific community to mitigate their harmful effects, including climate change and alteration of global biogeochemical cycles. In a world already transformed by human activity, the connection between humans and the ecosystems they depend on must frame any strategy for the recovery of the biota. \textbackslash{}n},

The exact causes of migraine are unknown, and no recognizable diagnostic pathological changes have been identified. Specific identifiable markers of migraine would aid diagnosis and could provide insight into the pathogenesis of the condition, with the potential to direct development of new therapeutics. In the past few years, advances in neuroimaging and genetic studies have provided the most substantial progress towards the identification of markers. A growing number of brain imaging studies have provided important insights into the brain mechanisms that underlie migraine symptoms during and between migraine attacks. Similarly, large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with the common forms of migraine - migraine with aura and migraine without aura. In total, 44 independent single-nucleotide polymorphism loci have been robustly associated with the risk of migraine and provide new evidence for the involvement of vascular mechanisms. Both imaging and genetics, therefore, have excellent potential as markers of migraine. In this Review, we provide a summary of results regarding current and potential neuroimaging and genetic markers of migraine, consider what conclusions can be drawn from these markers about migraine mechanisms and discuss the potential of combining imaging and genetics.},

Samples of bulked haploid megagametophytes were collected from two or three positions on each tree, assuming that the collections were far enough apart that the same mutant sector was not sampled twice. All samples were genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. A single mutation corresponding to a stepwise increase in one dinucleotide repeat was detected.

High gene flow among populations may be one of the most important factors in maintaining these genetic patterns. Here, we provide empirical evidence for extensive pollen-mediated gene dispersal between natural stands of a widespread northern temperate/boreal conifer, Picea glauca. We used 6 polymorphic allozyme loci to quantify the proportion of seeds sired by pollen originating from different sources in a landscape fragmented by agriculture in North Central Ontario, Canada. In 7 stands, a small proportion of seeds were sired by self-pollen or neighboring trees but 87.1\% (+/-1.7\% standard error [SE]) of seeds were sired by pollen from at least 250 to 3000 m away. In 4 single isolated trees, self-fertilization rates were low and more than 96\% (+/-1.3\% SE) of seeds were sired by immigrant pollen. The average minimum pollen dispersal distance in outcrossed matings was 619 m. These results provide strong evidence that extensive long-distance pollen dispersal plays a primary role in maintaining low genetic differentiation among natural populations of P. glauca and helps maintain genetic diversity and minimize inbreeding in small stands in a fragmented landscape.},

Franco) from western Oregon. In addition, the efficacy of bud phenology traits as predictors of cold hardiness at the two stages was explored. Fall and spring cold hardiness were assessed using artificial freeze testing. Similar genetic control of cold hardiness in seedlings and saplings is suggested by strong type-B genetic correlations (r(B)) between the two ages for fall and spring cold injury traits (r(B) greater than or equal to 0.78) and by similar trends in individual tree heritability estimates (h(i)(2)), e.g., h(i)(2) was greater in spring ((h) over bar (2)(i) = 0.73) than in fall ((h) over bar (2)(i) 0.36) and greater in the Coast population ((h) over bar (2)(i) = 0.69) than in the Cascade population ((h) over bar (2)(i) = 0.40) at both ages. Strong responses to direct selection are expected for spring cold hardiness at both ages and for fall cold hardiness in seedlings, even under mild selection intensities. Similar heritabilities in seedlings and saplings, and strong genetic correlations between ages for cold-hardiness traits, ensure that selection at one age will produce similar gains at the other age. Type-A genetic correlations (r(A)) between fall and spring cold hardiness were near zero in the Cascade population (r(A) = 0.08 and -0.14 at ages 2 and 7, respectively) but were moderate and negative in the Coast population (r(A) = -0.54 and -0.36, respectively). Bud-burst timing appears to be a suitable surrogate to artificial freeze testing for assessing spring cold hardiness in both seedlings and saplings, as is bud set timing for assessing fall cold hardiness in seedlings, but bud set timing is a poor predictor of fall cold hardiness in saplings.},

  abstract = {Genetics of fall and spring cold hardiness were investigated in two western Oregon breeding populations (Coast and Cascade mountains) of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Seedlings from 40 open-pollinated families from each population were grown in raised nursery beds and subjected to two soil-moisture regimes (well-watered and mild drought) to evaluate the influence of summer drought on ranking of families for cold hardiness. Artificial freeze testing (AFT) of detached shoots, followed by visual scoring of injury, was used to evaluate needle, stem and bud cold hardiness on three dates in the fall (September, October and November) after the second growing season, and once in the following spring (March). The Cascade population suffered significantly less cold injury than the Coast population in fall AFT. However, in spring AFT the Cascade population was less cold hardy, although population differences were seldom significant. Families within both breeding zones varied significantly in cold hardiness, with mean estimates of individual heritabilities greater in spring (h\=i2= 0.57) than fall (h\=i2= 0.37), greater in the Coast (h\=i2= 0.52) than in the Cascade (h\=i2= 0.42) population, and greater in the wet (h\=i2= 0.54) than in the dry moisture regime (h\=i2= 0.40) (fall means based on October tests). A single test date seems adequate to assess fall cold hardiness, because estimated genetic correlations for cold injury between fall test dates were strong (r\=A= 0.80). Genetic correlations between spring and fall cold injury, however, were moderately negative (r\=B= -0.66 and -0.21, Coast and Cascade, respectively), indicating that cold hardiness needs to be managed as two traits (i.e. fall and spring cold hardiness). Selection for cold hardiness based on a single shoot tissue is expected to increase cold hardiness in the other tissues as well, because genetic correlations between tissues in cold injury were moderately-to-strongly positive in both fall (r\=B= 0.67) and spring (r\=B= 0.84). Seedlings grown under summer drought incurred significantly less cold injury in the fall than those that were well-watered; nevertheless, strong genetic correlations in fall cold injury between moisture regimes (r\=B= 0.91) indicate that summer moisture conditions had little influence on family rankings for fall cold hardiness. Correlations of injury resulting from a natural frost event in November of the first year with injury from AFT in the fall of the second year (r\=A= 0.72 and 0.78 for needle and bud injury, respectively) confirmed that AFT reliably predicts cold hardiness to natural frost events. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

First, an adaptive map is created by using conven- tional genetic test data. Then, the large array of predicted adaptive values is subjected to cluster analysis, which assigns each grid cell of the region to one of a predetermined number of clusters (breeding zones) such that the sum of the squared distances between each cell's adaptive value and its cluster mean is minimized. This approach minimizes the average adaptive distance between the origin of a breeding program's selected trees and planting locations throughout the region of focus. The procedure is illustrated by the use of adaptive values of 69 interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. \texttimes{} Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) open-pollinated families (sources) from southeast British Columbia, Canada. Adaptive values of each 1.5 km \texttimes{} 1.5 km grid cell in the 80 000-km2 region were predicted using a geneco- logical model (R2 = 0.64), and the values were subjected to cluster analysis to identify breeding zone boundaries that were then mapped using a geographic information system. Regardless of the number of zones created, a regional maladaptation index was consistently smaller when zones were devised with area-based cluster (ABC) analysis than when zones were created by dividing the region into bands of equal elevational or adaptive-value widths. Application of the ABC procedure should assist in identifying the optimum breeding-zone alignment for a given number of zones},

The use of camera traps to estimate animal density has so far been restricted to capture\textendash{}recapture analysis of species with individually identifiable markings. This study developed a method that eliminates the requirement for individual recognition of animals by modelling the underlying process of contact between animals and cameras. 2. The model provides a factor that linearly scales trapping rate with density, depending on two key biological variables (average animal group size and day range) and two characteristics of the camera sensor (distance and angle within which it detects animals). 3. We tested the approach in an enclosed animal park with known abundances of four species, obtaining accurate estimates in three out of four cases. Inaccuracy in the fourth species was because of biased placement of cameras with respect to the distribution of this species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Subject to unbiased camera placement and accurate measurement of model parameters, this method opens the possibility of reduced labour costs for estimating wildlife density and may make estimation possible where it has not been previously. We provide guidelines on the trapping effort required to obtain reasonably precise estimates.},

  abstract = {Succulent water storage is a prominent feature among plants adapted to arid zones, but we know little about how succulence evolves and how it is integrated into organs already tasked with multiple functions. Increased volume in succulent leaves, for example, may result in longer transport distances between veins and the cells that they supply, which in turn could negatively impact photosynthesis [1-4]. We quantified water storage [5] in a group of 83 closely related species to examine the evolutionary dynamics of succulence and leaf venation. In most leaves, vein density decreased with increasing succulence, resulting in significant increases in the path length of water from veins to evaporative surfaces. The most succulent leaves, however, had a distinct three-dimensional (3D) venation pattern, which evolved 11-12 times within this small lineage, likely via multiple developmental pathways. 3D venation "resets" internal leaf distances, maintaining moderate vein density in extremely succulent tissues and suggesting that the evolution of extreme succulence is constrained by the need to maintain an efficient leaf hydraulic system. The repeated evolution of 3D venation decouples leaf water storage from hydraulic path length, facilitating the evolutionary exploration of novel phenotypic space. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Nature is organized into complex, dynamical networks of species and their interactions, which may influence diversity and stability. However, network research is, generally, short-term and depict ecological networks as static structures only, devoid of any dynamics. This hampers our understanding of how nature responds to larger disturbances such as changes in climate. In order to remedy this we studied the long-term (12-yrs) dynamics of a flower-visitation network, consisting of flower-visiting butterflies and their nectar plants. Global network properties, i.e. numbers of species and links, as well as connectance, were temporally stable, whereas most species and links showed a strong temporal dynamics. However, species of butterflies and plants varied bimodally in their temporal persistance: Sporadic species, being present only 1-2(-5) years, and stable species, being present (9-)11-12 years, dominated the networks. Temporal persistence and linkage level of species, i.e. number of links to other species, made up two groups of species: Specialists with a highly variable temporal persistence, and temporally stable species with a highly variable linkage level. Turnover of links of specialists was driven by species turnover, whereas turnover of links among generalists took place through rewiring, i.e. by reshuffling existing interactions. However, in spite of this strong internal dynamics of species and links the network appeared overall stable. If this global stability-local instability phenomenon is general, it is a most astonishing feature of ecological networks.},

  abstract = {Plant \textendash{} pollinator mutualistic networks represent the ecological context of foraging (for pollinators) and reproduction (for plants and some pollinators). Plant \textendash{} pollinator visitation networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats and species assemblages. Th e most successful hypotheses to explain these network properties are the neutrality and biological constraints hypotheses, which posit that species interaction frequencies can be explained by species relative abundances, and trait mismatches between potential mutualists respectively. However, previous network analyses emphasize the prediction of metrics of qualitative network structure, which may not represent stringent tests of these hypotheses. Using a newly documented temporally explicit alpine plant \textendash{} pollinator visitation network, we show that metrics of both qualitative and quantitative network structure are easy to predict, even by models that predict the identity or frequency of species interactions poorly. A variety of phenological and morphological constraints as well as neutral interactions successfully predicted all network metrics tested, without accurately predicting species observed interactions. Species phenology alone was the best predictor of observed interaction frequencies. However, all models were poor predic-tors of species pairwise interaction frequencies, suggesting that other aspects of species biology not generally considered in network studies, such as reproduction for dipterans, play an important role in shaping plant \textendash{} pollinator visitation network structure at this site. Future progress in explaining the structure and dynamics of mutualistic networks will require new approaches that emphasize accurate prediction of species pairwise interactions rather than network metrics, and better refl ect the biology underlying species interactions. Mutualistic interactions between plants and their animal pollinators exhibit tremendous diversity in their nature and specifi city, ranging from highly specialized species pairings to indiscriminate generalists (Jordano 1987, Waser et al. 1996). At the community level, this variation emerges as a network of mutualistic interactions specifying both who pollinates whom, and who provides food resources for whom. Studies of pollination interaction networks have increasingly focused on identifying causal links between species ' traits and the detailed structure of species interactions in order to predict the ecological and evolutionary dynam-ics of plants and their animal pollinators (Strauss and Irwin 2004, V {\'a} zquez et al. 2009a, Junker et al. 2010, 2013). Pollination interaction networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats, species assem-blages, and time (Jordano et al. 2003, V {\'a} zquez et al. 2009a). Interaction networks are sparse (a small fraction of all possible interactions are actually observed, i.e. connectance is low), nested (specialized species tend to interact with a proper subset of the species with which generalists interact), exhibit skewed ' degree distributions ' (most plants are pollinated by only a few pollinators, and most pollinators pollinate only a few plants), and species are signifi cantly more specialized than expected given the availability of potential mutualistic partners (Jordano et al. 2003, Bl {\"u} thgen et al. 2008, Dupont et al. 2009). Th e generality of these network structural prop-erties suggests general underlying mechanisms (Jordano et al. 2003), and recent network studies have emphasized the need to test putative determinants of network structure, such as species traits and abundances (V {\'a} zquez et al. 2007, 2009b). Several hypotheses for underlying determinants of network structure have been supported by empirical and theoretical work, the most successful of which are the neu-trality and biological constraints hypotheses. Under the neutrality hypothesis, species interact randomly, resulting in interaction frequencies proportional to relative species abundances (V {\'a} zquez and Aizen 2004, Canard et al. 2014). Th e biological constraints hypothesis posits that constraints imposed through trait mismatches between potential mutu-alists strongly infl uence network structure (Jordano et al. 2003, Santamaria and Rodriguez-Girones 2007). It is important to note that both neutral and trait-based mod-els constrain predicted network structure by identifying interactions that are impossible or unlikely due to low local abundances, trait mis-matches, or both. Studies that have evaluated both hypotheses suggest that metrics of network structure like connectance and nestedness are best predicted by a combination of neutral interactions and various biological},

  abstract = {Evolutionary changes are determined by a complex assortment of ecological, demographic, and adaptive histories. Predicting how evolution will shape the genetic structures of populations coping with current (and future) environmental challenges has principally relied on investigations through space, in lieu of time, because long-term phenotypic and molecular data are scarce. Yet, dormant propagules in sediments, soils, and permafrost are convenient natural archives of population histories from which to trace adaptive trajectories along extended time periods. DNA sequence data obtained from these natural archives, combined with pioneering methods for analyzing both ecological and population genomic time-series data, are likely to provide predictive models to forecast evolutionary responses of natural populations to environmental changes resulting from natural and anthropogenic stressors, including climate change. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  author = {{ESA (Ecological Society of America)}},
  year = {2006},
  pages = {1--45},
  abstract = {In its 1993 report, the Women and Minorities in Ecology (WAMIE) Committee developed a vision for the Ecological Society of America (ESA): ``To achieve a population of ecologists that reflects the gender and cultural diversity of the general population of the United States.'' Ten years later, a new Women and Minorities in Ecology Committee (WAMIE II) was formed to assess the progress made toward implementing the original report's recommendations. Since the first WAMIE report was published, ESA has made significant progress in several areas. Most notable was the addition of an Education Section to implement WAMIE I recommendations. An important achievement under the direction of ESA's Education Section was the creation of the Strategies in Ecology Education, Development, and Sustainability (SEEDS) program. Through SEEDS, ESA has seen an increase in the participation of underrepresented undergraduate students at ESA meetings, and SEEDS mentoring activities, field trips, Chapters, and outreach efforts have been instrumental in developing interest in ecology among minority undergraduate students. Other recommendations implemented by ESA include: the addition of childcare at ESA meetings, the creation of the Education and Human Resources Committee (EHRC), the publication of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment as a potential venue for articles on education and women and minority issues, the development of a new ESA award to recognize teaching and mentoring in ecology, the sponsorship of diversity mixers and diversity luncheons at ESA Annual Meetings, and the diversification of its Profile of Ecologists series. In this report, prepared by the WAMIE II Committee, we review recommendations made in the original WAMIE report, present an overview of actions taken to date, and make specific recommendations in each area. We also analyze demographic trends in the United States to determine how ESA membership compares to the general population of the US. Our preliminary findings indicate that there continues to be a serious under-representation of women and minorities in ecology. We also recognize that diversity issues should be integrated within the larger vision of ESA. Critical and emerging issues should be taken into account in ESA's future plans, including actions that will promote the relevance of ecology to address local ecological and environmental justice issues. Attention must also be paid to fostering retention of graduate students, post-docs and young professionals, broadening the career horizons of ecologists beyond academic positions, and developing leadership skills including communicating science to a broad audience. Diversity issues encompass more than gender, race, and ethnicity, and another group that must be considered in future plans is ecologists with disabilities; this sector of the population was left out of WAMIE I, and we cannot let the same omission occur again. We have chosen not to address it in detail this time, although we recognize that parallel issues exist in many cases and there are many other characteristics that constitute diversity. This report makes several concrete recommendations that can be implemented immediately. It also makes two major recommendations for developing future plans: 1. Organize a workshop with a larger representation of ESA members to develop an action plan for the next decade and beyond in the context of the Ecological Visions report. 2. Conduct a new survey of ESA members by a professional organization in consultation with the WAMIE II committee. It is only with accurate data that we can truly learn how much ESA has advanced towards its vision of achieving a society that mirrors the general population of the United States.},

One goal of meta-analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists, however, are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse, ecologically based metrics of effect size, with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models, we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the metaanalysis.},

  abstract = {We investigated the role of phenolic and phenolic-related traits of the leaves of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) as determinants of their suitability for the growth of larvae of the geometrid Epirrita autumnata. As parameters of leaf suitability, we determined the contents of total phenolics, gallotannins, soluble and cell-wall-bound proanthocyanidins (PAS and PAB, respectively), lignin, protein precipitation capacity of tannins (PPC), and leaf toughness. In addition, we examined concentrations of soluble carbohydrates and protein-bound amino acids as background variables describing the nutritive value of leaves. The correlation of the leaf traits of our 40 study trees with the tree-specific relative growth rate (RGR) of E. autumnata showed that the only significant correlation with RGR was that of PAS - the largest fraction of total phenolics - and even that explained only 15\% of the variation in E. autumnata growth. The nonlinear estimation of the relationship between RGR and PAS by piecewise linear regression divided the 40 study trees into two groups: (i) 19 trees with good leaves for E. autumnata (RGR ranging from 0.301 to 0.390), and (ii) 21 trees with poor leaves (RGR ranging from 0.196 to 0.296). The suitability of leaves within these two groups of trees was determined by different phenolic traits. Within the good group, the suitability of leaves for larvae was determined by the PPC of extracts, which strongly correlated with gallotannins, and by the total content of gallotannins. In contrast, the leaves of poor trees had significantly higher contents of both PAS and PAB, but leaf toughness correlated only negatively with the RGR of E. autumnata larvae. We also discuss the causes of variation in the phenolic and phenolic-related factors that determine the suitability of leaves for E. autumnata larvae in different groups of trees. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {A long-standing goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the conditions that promote the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. The factors promoting sympatric speciation have been of particular interest, both because it is notoriously difficult to prove empirically and because theoretical models have generated conflicting results, depending on the assumptions made. Here, we analyze the conditions under which selection favors the evolution of assortative mating, thereby reducing gene flow between sympatric groups, using a general model of selection, which allows fitness to be frequency dependent. Our analytical results are based on a two-locus diploid model, with one locus altering the trait under selection and the other locus controlling the strength of assortment (a "one-allele" model). Examining both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that whenever heterozygotes are less fit, on average, than homozygotes at the trait locus, indirect selection for assortative mating is generated. While costs of assortative mating hinder the evolution of reproductive isolation, they do not prevent it unless they are sufficiently great. Assortative mating that arises because individuals mate within groups (formed in time or space) is most conducive to the evolution of complete assortative mating from random mating. Assortative mating based on female preferences is more restrictive, because the resulting sexual selection can lead to loss of the trait polymorphism and cause the relative fitness of heterozygotes to rise above homozygotes, eliminating the force favoring assortment. When assortative mating is already prevalent, however, sexual selection can itself cause low heterozygous fitness, promoting the evolution of complete reproductive isolation (akin to "reinforcement") regardless of the form of natural selection.},

However, community responses of functionally important arthropod\textbackslash{}ntaxa to changing climatic conditions are mostly unknown. 2. In this\textbackslash{}nstudy, an earlier snowmelt was simulated at 15 plots along an elevational\textbackslash{}ngradient in the German Alps. At each study site, soil emergence traps\textbackslash{}nwere established for sampling soil-hibernating arthropods on earlier\textbackslash{}nand control snowmelt treatments during the growing season, The abundance\textbackslash{}nand emergence phenology of the live most common arthropod orders\textbackslash{}n(Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera) were analysed,\textbackslash{}nas well as the species richness of Coleoptera. 3. There was increasing\textbackslash{}nabundance and species richness of Coleoptera along the elevational\textbackslash{}ngradient, indicating that at higher altitudes more individuals and\textbackslash{}nspecies hibernate in the soil. Abundances of Diptera also increased\textbackslash{}nwith elevation. By contrast, abundances of Hemiptera declined with\textbackslash{}nincreasing elevation, while abundances of Araneae and Hymenoptera\textbackslash{}ndid not show significant elevational patterns. Arthropods at higher\textbackslash{}nelevations emerged, on average, 5 weeks later than arthropods at\textbackslash{}nlower elevations, because of a longer-lasting snow cover. The earlier\textbackslash{}nsnowmelt treatment resulted in higher abundances of Araneae and Hymenoptera\textbackslash{}ncompared with the control plots, indicating that the time of snowmelt\textbackslash{}ninfluenced the abundance of predators, such as spiders or parasitic\textbackslash{}nwasps, more than that of herbivores. 4.

How eight coefficients responded to differences among modern pollen samples from eastern North America was tested. These coefficients represent three different classes: (1) unweighted coefficients that are most strongly influenced by large-valued pollen types, (2) equal-weight coefficients that weight all pollen types equally but can be too sensitive to variations among rare types, and (3) signal0to-noise coefficients that are intermediate in their weighting of pollen types. The studies with modern pollen allowed definition of critical values for each coefficient, which, when not exceeded, indicate that two pollen samples originate from the same vegetation region. Dissimilarity coefficients were used to compare modern and fossil pollen samples, and modern samples so similar to fossil samples were found that most of three late Quaternary pollen diagrams could be "reconstructed" by substituting modern samples for fossil samples. When the coefficients indicated that the fossil spectra had no modern analogs, then the reconstructed diagrams did not match all aspects of the originals. No modern analogs existed for samples from before 9300 yr B.P. at Kirchner Marsh, Minnesota, and from before 11,000 yr B.P. at Wintergreen Lake, Michigan, but modern analogs existed for almost all Holocene samples from these two sites and Brandreth Bog.

  abstract = {The phenology of post-dormancy pollen cone, pollen, seed cone, and ovule development was determined for western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don) growing at a coastal and an interior seed orchard in British Columbia. Pollen cones were preformed and overwintered at the sporogenous cell stage before resuming development in early April. Meiosis occurred in May, and pollen was mature by late May or early June. Potential seed-cone buds resumed development in mid-April, and all bracts and ovuliferous scales were initiated before seed-cone buds burst. Comparable stages of development occurred about 2 weeks earlier at the coastal orchard. Numerical phenological stages were assigned to both pollen-cone and seed-cone development. Pollen-cone and seed-cone phenology were very dependent on temperature, whereas pollen release was dependent on both temperature and drying. Degree-days are a useful way to predict seed cone receptivity and to a lesser extent pollen shed at one site in successive years but not between sites. Receptivity and pollen release were fairly synchronized at both sites in both years of the study. The pollination mechanism is described and was similar to other pines studied in a similar manner. Seed cones were erect at receptivity and ovules inverted. Lipid microdrops were secreted on the micropylar arms to which the saccate pollen adhere. After several days of pollen collection on the arms and other cone surfaces, a pollination drop was secreted from the ovule, and if it was large it filled the space between the micropylar arms. Many large pollination drops were observed in cones at the coastal orchard, and the drops scavenged pollen from the arms and nearby cone surfaces. Few and small pollination drops were observed in cones at the interior orchard where low humidity may cause rapid evaporation of the drop. Water applied as a spray at the interior site increased the size of pollination drops or created artificial drops between the arms. At both sites water applied as a fine spray after pollen shed carried pollen from the hairs on the margins of the bracts and scales into the cone and to the ovules. The pollination mechanism in western white pine is well adapted to the wet humid coastal environment but not as well adapted to the dry interior.},

Pollination lasted about 2 weeks, between mid-May and mid-June. Pollen shedding and female receptivity showed homogamy, protandry, or protogyny depending on weather, site, and year. Morphological and developmental features explain why pollination as early as stage 3 was most successful and why self-pollination led to a seriously reduced production of filled seed. Early pollination increased the seed potential per cone and consequently the filled seed per cone. Cone drop occurred when less than 80\% of ovules were pollinated per cone and was higher in trees from Prince George than those in the Okanagan Valley. Misting of trees and mechanical blowing of pollen in the orchards did not increase filled seed per cone. Clonal effect was the most important factor in all trials and has implications for orchard management.},

PNWNAmet was created using the trivariate thin plate spline interpolation method with the algorithm implemented by Nychka et al. (2017). Minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation were interpolated separately using latitude, longitude and a 1971-2000 climatology from ClimateWNA (v5.10) as predictors. ClimateWNA uses bilinear interpolation and an elevation adjustment  to create a scale-free, smooth at the boundaries, mosaic of available climatologies (Wang et al., 2006). Climatologies included were the latest available for the provinces, territories and states within NWNA, such as the 800 m, 1971-2000, PRISM products for BC and the contiguous US (Anslow, 2015; Daly et al., 2008). Elevation used in ClimateWNA was derived from the GEMTED2010 digital elevation model (Danielson and Gesch, 2011). Precipitation occurrence and square-root transformed precipitation amounts were interpolated separately on each day, combined, and transformed back to original units. After interpolation, the raw daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation surfaces were rescaled so that their climatological monthly means matched those of ClimateWNA following Hunter and Meetemeyer (2005). Wind data is also included, which is derived by re-gridding 10-m wind speed from the 20th Century Reanalysis V2 (20CR2) (Compo et al., 2011), as these are required by the VIC-GL hydrologic model. The wind data have not been adjusted to take wind field deformation by small-scale topographic features into account.

Station records were obtained from the second generation of Environment and Climate Change Canada's Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) (Mekis and Vincent, 2011; Vincent et al., 2012, 2002), the homogenized United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) in the contiguous US (Williams et al., 2006) and the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-Daily) in Alaska (Menne et al., 2012). To maintain temporal consistency, selected stations had to have at least 40 years of complete records ({$<$} 10\% missing days within a year) over the 1945-2012 period. To supplement sparse observations around the western and northern coasts of Alaska, daily data from  20CR2 (Compo et al., 2011) were used as virtual stations as they were the only daily reanalysis data available that cover the full 1945-2012 period.}

Negative feedback between plant and soil communities could be a more effective mechanism promoting species coexistence because soil pathogens can increase rapidly in the presence of their host, causing conditions unfavourable for local conspecific recruitment. Here we show that a soil pathogen leads to patterns of seedling mortality in a temperate tree (Prunus serotina) as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. In the field, the mean distance to parent of seedling cohorts shifted away from maternal trees over a period of 3 years. Seedlings were grown in soil collected 0-5 m or 25-30 m from Prunus trees. Sterilization of soil collected beneath trees improved seedling survival relative to unsterilized soil, whereas sterilization of distant soil did not affect survival. Pythium spp., isolated from roots of dying seedlings and used to inoculate healthy seedlings, decreased survival by 65\% relative to controls. Our results provide the most complete evidence that native pathogens influence tree distributions, as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, and suggest that similar ecological mechanisms operate in tropical and temperate forests.},

  abstract = {Understanding cooperation is a central challenge in biology, because natural selection should favor "free-loaders" that reap benefits without reciprocating. For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a "sterilization parasite" that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these "parasites" enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation.},

  abstract = {The understanding of airborne pollen transportation is crucial for the reconstruction of the paleoenvironment. Under favorable conditions, a considerable amount of long-distance-transported pollen can be deposited far from its place of origin. In extreme arid regions, in most cases, such situations occur and increase the difficulty to interpret fossil pollen records. In this study, three sets of Cour airborne pollen trap were installed on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountains to collect airborne Picea schrenkiana (spruce) pollen grains from July 2001 to July 2006. The results indicate that Picea pollen disperses extensively and transports widely in the lower atmosphere far away from spruce forest. The airborne Picea pollen dispersal period is mainly concentrated between mid-May and July. In desert area, weekly Picea pollen began to increase and peaked suddenly in concentration. Also, annual pollen indices do not decline even when the distance increased was probably related to the strong wind may pick up the deposited pollen grains from the topsoil into the air stream, leading to an increase of pollen concentration in the air that is irrelevant to the normal and natural course of pollen transport and deposition. This, in turn, may lead to erroneous interpretations of the pollen data in the arid region. This study provided insight into the shift in the Picea pollen season regarding climate change in arid areas. It is recorded that the pollen pollination period starts earlier and the duration became longer. The results also showed that the temperature of May and June was positively correlated with the Picea pollen production. Furthermore, the transport of airborne Picea pollen data is useful for interpreting fossil pollen records from extreme arid regions.},

Flowering time responses to climate change of wind-pollinated species have, however, been less well studied. A novel source of flowering time data for wind-pollinated species is allergen monitoring records. Methods We studied the male flowering time response to climatic variables of two wind-pollinated genera, Betula (Betulaceae) and Populus (Salicaceae), using pollen count records over a 17-year period. Key Results We found that changes in the pollen release envelope differed between the two genera. Over the study period, the only month with a significant rise in temperature was April, resulting in the duration of pollen release of the April-flowering Populus to shorten and the start and peak of the May-flowering Betula to advance. The quantity of pollen released by Betula has increased and was related to increases in the previous year's August precipitation, while the quantity of pollen released by Populus has not changed and was related to the previous year's summer and autumn temperatures. Conclusions Our findings suggest that taxa differ in the reproductive consequences of environmental change. Differing shifts in phenology among species may be related to different rates of change in climatic variables in different months of the year. While our study only considers two genera, the results underscore the importance of understanding non-uniform intra-annual variation in climate when studying the ecological implications of climate change.},

Three dispersal strategies are considered where all, half or none of the offspring disperse. The spatial scale (number of patches) and the temporal scale (probability of local extinction) of the environment are critical in determining the selective advantage of the different dispersal strategies. The results from the simulations suggest that an interaction between group selection and individual selection results in a different outcome in relation to the spatial and temporal scales of the environment. Such an interaction is able to maintain a polymorphism in dispersal strategies. The maintenance of this polymorphism is also scale-dependent. This study suggests a mechanism for the short-term evolution of dispersal, and provides a testable prediction of this hypothesis, namely that loss of dispersal abilities should be more frequent in spatially more continuous environments, or in temporally more stable environments.},

Three distributions were used, all assuming continuous space; a maximum likelihood approach was used for parameter estimation and model selection. Numerical simulations showed that our method is statistically consistent since it selected the correct model with increasing frequency when sample size increased. Ringing data on two species of tits (Parus caeruleus and Parus major) in Britain and Ireland were used to illustrate the potentialities of our method. In both species, adults dispersed significantly further than juveniles. The differences between species within an age-class were not statistically significant. In all species and age-classes, the model finally selected was the one assuming a heavy-tailed half-Cauchy distribution where long-distance dispersers are predicted to be more frequent than in the exponential model. The proposed methodology can potentially be applied to any organisms, and the model selection procedure can be used with any model of the distribution of dispersal distances (DDD). Several extensions are presented in the discussion, such as generalized linear modeling of the dispersal parameters, or interfacing with capture-recapture models. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The receptive period of the female strobili and the shedding period of the male strobili were observed visually. Airborne pollen was monitored with Rotorod traps located inside and outside the seed orchard. There was no time gap in the onset of flowering between the earliest female and male strobili in 1992. Female flowering began 3 days earlier than male flowering in 1993, and the earliest strobili were probably pollinated by pollen transported long distance from more southerly areas. The almost simultaneous peak in pollen occurrence inside the seed orchard and in surrounding pine stands indicates that the seed orchard clones are not temporally isolated from sources of contamination. However, pollen concentrations inside the seed orchard were higher than those in the surrounding stands. Therefore, flowering phenology cannot sufficiently explain the observed pollen contamination rates in this seed orchard.},

  abstract = {Pine cones that remain closed and retain seeds until fire causes the cones to open (cone serotiny) represent a key adaptive trait in a variety of pine species. In lodgepole pine, there is substantial geographical variation in serotiny across the Rocky Mountain region. This variation in serotiny has evolved as a result of geographically divergent selection, with consequences that extend to forest communities and ecosystems. An understanding of the genetic architecture of this trait is of interest owing to the wide-reaching ecological consequences of serotiny and also because of the repeated evolution of the trait across the genus. Here, we present and utilize an inexpensive and time-effective method for generating population genomic data. The method uses restriction enzymes and PCR amplification to generate a library of fragments that can be sequenced with a high level of multiplexing. We obtained data for more than 95,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 98 serotinous and nonserotinous lodgepole pines from three populations. We used a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) to test for an association between genotypic variation at these loci and serotiny. The probability of serotiny varied by genotype at 11 loci, and the association between genotype and serotiny at these loci was consistent in each of the three populations of pines. Genetic variation across these 11 loci explained 50\% of the phenotypic variation in serotiny. Our results provide a first genome-wide association map of serotiny in pines and demonstrate an inexpensive and efficient method for generating population genomic data.},

An important factor in the decline is butternut canker, a disease caused by the fungus Ophiognomonia clavigigenti-juglandacearum, which has left the remaining butternuts isolated and sparsely distributed. To manage the remaining populations effectively, information regarding how butternut's population genetic structure is affected by environmental and historical factors is needed. In this study, we assessed genetic structure and diversity of 161 butternut trees from 19 adjacent watersheds in the southern portion of butternut's range using 12 microsatellite markers. We assessed the genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among trees grouped at various spatial scales. Our goal was to use historical abundance and land use data for these watersheds, which are now all a part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), to understand the ecological and evolutionary forces that challenge the conservation and management of butternut. In general, butternuts within the 19 neighboring watersheds were all part of one continuous population, with gene flow throughout. Significant genetic differentiation was detected between some groups of trees, but the differentiation was quite small and may not represent an ecologically significant distinction. The mean heterozygosity in all watersheds remained high, despite extensive mortality. Overall, genetic diversity and rare alleles were evenly distributed across all watersheds, with some variability in subpopulations containing butternut-Japanese walnut hybrids (Juglans x bixbyi or buarts). These results indicate that management of this species should focus on protection from future hybridization with Japanese walnut, promotion of regeneration, and persistence of all remaining butternut trees, which still retain high levels of genetic diversity.},

  abstract = {As the climate changes, drought may reduce tree productivity and survival across many forest ecosystems; however, the relative influence of specific climate parameters on forest decline is poorly understood. We derive a forest drought-stress index (FDSI) for the southwestern United States using a comprehensive tree-ring data set representing AD 1000\textendash{}2007. The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by thewarm-season vapour-pressure deficit (largely controlled by temperature) and cold-season precipitation, together explaining 82\% of the FDSI variability. Correspondence between the FDSI and measures of forest productivity, mortality, bark-beetle outbreak and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic forest-vigour indicator. If the vapour-pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models, the mean forest drought-stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years. Collectively, the results foreshadow twenty-first-century changes in forest structures and compositions, with transition of forests in the southwestern United States, and perhaps water-limited forests globally, towards distributions unfamiliar to modern civilization.

  abstract = {Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level},

  abstract = {We analyzed the impact of drought measured on different time-scales on radial growth of eight tree species during the period 1950-2005 growing across a wide climatic gradient encompassing semiarid Mediterranean woodlands and wet mountain forests in north-eastern Spain. A drought index (standardized precipitation index, SPI) at different time scales (1-48 months) was correlated with chronologies of ring width to determine the significant time scale at which drought affected most tree growth. The findings indicated that the impact of drought on growth varied noticeably among species and sites. Two distinct patterns were clearly observed considering spatial and temporal differences in the response of species to drought. Species growing in xeric sites (Pinus and Quercus species and Juniperus thurifera) showed the highest responses to SPI time-scales of 9-11 months while those located in mesic sites (Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris) did respond more to SPI time scales shorter than 5 months. The SPI-growth correlations were significant, although weak, up to 30 months in xeric sites while no consistent association was observed at higher time scales. Important seasonal differences were noticed in the SPI-growth associations. Species growing in xeric areas responded to spring-summer SPI while those distributed in mesic sites responded more to summer SPI. Our findings should be useful to understand forest responses to climate change, including an increasing frequency of severe droughts, and to adapt appropriate management strategies to mitigate the impact of drought on tree growth. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Much of this research has focused on phenology \textendash{} the timing of life-history events. Phenology has well-demonstrated links to climate, from genetic to landscape scales; yet our ability to explain and predict variation in phenology across species, habitats and time remains poor. Here, we outline how merging approaches from ecology, climate science and evolutionary biology can advance research on phenological responses to climate variability. Using insight into seasonal and interannual climate variability combined with niche theory and community phylogenetics, we develop a predictive approach for species' reponses to changing climate. Our approach predicts that species occupying higher latitudes or the early growing season should be most sensitive to climate and have the most phylogenetically conserved phenologies. We further predict that temperate species will respond to climate change by shifting in time, while tropical species will respond by shifting space, or by evolving. Although we focus here on plant phenology, our approach is broadly applicable to ecological research of plant responses to climate variability.},

  abstract = {Geographic range margins offer testing grounds for limits to adaptation. If range limits are concordant with niche limits, range expansions require the evolution of new phenotypes that can maintain populations beyond current range margins. However, many species' range margins appear static over time, suggesting limits on the ability of marginal populations to evolve appropriate phenotypes. A potential explanation is the swamping gene flow hypothesis, which posits that asymmetrical gene flow from large, well-adapted central populations prevents marginal populations from locally adapting. We present an empirical framework for combining gene flow, environment, and fitness-related phenotypes to infer the potential for maladaptation, and we demonstrate its application using the scarlet monkeyflower Mimulus cardinalis. We grew individuals sampled from populations on a latitudinal transect under varied temperatures and determined the phenotypic deviation (PD), the mismatch between phenotype and local environment. We inferred gene flow among populations and predicted that populations receiving the most temperature- or latitude-weighted immigration would show the greatest PD and that these populations were likely marginal. We found asymmetrical gene flow from central to marginal populations. Populations with more latitude-weighted immigration had significantly greater PD but were not necessarily marginal. Gene flow may limit local adaptation in this species, but swamping gene flow is unlikely to explain its northern range limit.},

  abstract = {Given the observed heterogeneity in fire severity produced within wildfires, we asked to what extent this heterogeneity might affect post-fire regeneration. For this purpose, we studied the post-fire dynamics of Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) in the eastern Iberian Peninsula. Sampling was stratified on the basis of fire severity. We defined three fire severity classes based on the degree of consumption of the pine canopy. The results suggested that there is no clear relationship between seedling density and fire severity; however, mortality was lower and growth (height, shoot biomass and root biomass) was higher in the high severity class. These results can be explained by soil processes: Sites in the high fire severity class may have sustained higher fire intensities, resulting in higher soil organic matter mineralisation and higher ash deposition, and thus in higher post-fire soil fertility. This higher fertility would produce faster growth in pine seedlings. Independent of the severity class, seedling mortality was higher in quadrats (50 \texttimes{} 50 cm) with higher cover of the perennial grass Brachypodium retusum (Poaceae), suggesting a possible competitive effect. For all plots in all 3 severity classes, spatial analysis suggests an aggregate seedlings pattern, but with independence from the position of the adult (source) trees.},

  abstract = {We study the trajectory of an allele that affects a polygenic trait selected toward a phenotypic optimum. Furthermore, conditioning on this trajectory we analyze the effect of the selected mutation on linked neutral variation. We examine the well-characterized two-locus two-allele model but we also provide results for diallelic models with up to eight loci. First, when the optimum phenotype is that of the double heterozygote in a two-locus model, and there is no dominance or epistasis of effects on the trait, the trajectories of selected mutations rarely reach fixation; instead, a polymorphic equilibrium at both loci is approached. Whether a polymorphic equilibrium is reached (rather than fixation at both loci) depends on the intensity of selection and the relative distances to the optimum of the homozygotes at each locus. Furthermore, if both loci have similar effects on the trait, fixation of an allele at a given locus is less likely when it starts at low frequency and the other locus is polymorphic (with alleles at intermediate frequencies). Weaker selection increases the probability of fixation of the studied allele, as the polymorphic equilibrium is less stable in this case. When we do not require the double heterozygote to be at the optimum we find that the polymorphic equilibrium is more difficult to reach, and fixation becomes more likely. Second, increasing the number of loci decreases the probability of fixation, because adaptation to the optimum is possible by various combinations of alleles. Summaries of the genealogy (height, total length, and imbalance) and of sequence polymorphism (number of polymorphisms, frequency spectrum, and haplotype structure) next to a selected locus depend on the frequency that the selected mutation approaches at equilibrium. We conclude that multilocus response to selection may in some cases prevent selective sweeps from being completed, as described in previous studies, but that conditions causing this to happen strongly depend on the genetic architecture of the trait, and that fixation of selected mutations is likely in many instances.},

  abstract = {Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

Here we investigate the impact that the choice of model can have on predictions, identify key reasons why model output may differ and discuss the implications that model uncertainty has for policy-guiding applications. Location The Western Cape of South Africa. Methods We applied nine of the most widely used modelling techniques to model potential distributions under current and predicted future climate for four species (including two subspecies) of Proteaceae. Each model was built using an identical set of five input variables and distribution data for 3996 sampled sites. We compare model predictions by testing agreement between observed and simulated distributions for the present day (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and kappa statistics) and by assessing consistency in predictions of range size changes under future climate (using cluster analysis). Results Our analyses show significant differences between predictions from different models, with predicted changes in range size by 2030 differing in both magnitude and direction (e.g. from 92\% loss to 322\% gain). We explain differences with reference to two characteristics of the modelling techniques: data input requirements (presence/absence vs. presence-only approaches) and assumptions made by each algorithm when extrapolating beyond the range of data used to build the model. The effects of these factors should be carefully considered when using this modelling approach to predict species ranges. Main Conclusions We highlight an important source of uncertainty in assessments of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and emphasize that model predictions should be interpreted in policy-guiding applications along with a full appreciation of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Background: Proper assessment of the harms caused by the misuse of drugs can inform policy makers in health, policing, and social care. We aimed to apply multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) modelling to a range of drug harms in the UK. Method: Members of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, including two invited specialists, met in a 1-day interactive workshop to score 20 drugs on 16 criteria: nine related to the harms that a drug produces in the individual and seven to the harms to others. Drugs were scored out of 100 points, and the criteria were weighted to indicate their relative importance. Findings: MCDA modelling showed that heroin, crack cocaine, and metamfetamine were the most harmful drugs to individuals (part scores 34, 37, and 32, respectively), whereas alcohol, heroin, and crack cocaine were the most harmful to others (46, 21, and 17, respectively). Overall, alcohol was the most harmful drug (overall harm score 72), with heroin (55) and crack cocaine (54) in second and third places. Interpretation: These findings lend support to previous work assessing drug harms, and show how the improved scoring and weighting approach of MCDA increases the differentiation between the most and least harmful drugs. However, the findings correlate poorly with present UK drug classification, which is not based simply on considerations of harm.

In this work, we study one of the most fundamental aspects of the genetics of adaptation in changing environments: the establishment of new beneficial mutations. We use the framework of time-dependent branching processes to derive simple approximations for the establishment probability of new mutations assuming that temporal changes in the offspring distribution are small. This approach allows us to generalize Haldane's classic result for the fixation probability in a constant environment to arbitrary patterns of temporal change in selection coefficients. Under weak selection, the only aspect of temporal variation that enters the probability of establishment is a weighted average of selection coefficients. These weights quantify how much earlier generations contribute to determining the establishment probability compared to later generations. We apply our results to several biologically interesting cases such as selection coefficients that change in consistent, periodic, and random ways and to changing population sizes. Comparison with exact results shows that the approximation is very accurate.},

Here we investigated the novel hypothesis that inaccurate mimicry (in color and shape) is maintained by opposing selective pressures from a suite of different predators: model-aversive visually oriented predators and model- and mimic-specialized predators indifferent to mimetic cues. We hypothesize that spiders resembling ants in color and shape escape predators that typically avoid ants but fall prey to ant-eating predators. We tested whether inaccurate myrmecomorphic spiders are perceived as their models by two types of predators and whether they can escape from these predators. We found that model-specialized (ant-eating) predators captured mimics significantly less frequently than their ant models, because mimics changed their behavior by fleeing predatory attacks. The fastest escape was found in less accurate mimics, indicating a negative association between visual resemblance and effectiveness of defenses. In trials with spider-eating predators, mimics were not captured more frequently than their models. The quality of defensive mechanisms appears to result from opposing selection forces exerted by the predator complex: mimics are more accurate (in color and shape) in microhabitats dominated by model-aversive predators and less accurate in microhabitats with model- and mimic-specialized predators.},

However, actual data of plant species' altitudinal shifts are still scarce and not always clear. Here we provide a more detailed investigation of a previously reported European beech Fagus sylvatica forest altitudinal shift in the Montseny Mountains (Catalonia, NE Spain) now based on field photographic survey and on the population age structure and the recruitment patterns in the high Fagus limit (HFL), the central forest area (CFA) and the low Fagus limit (LFL). Monitoring of the lowest altitudinal range shows that beech forest is being progressively replaced by Mediterranean holm oak forest. Holm oaks are characterized by recruitment rates more than three times higher than those of beech in the LFL in the last decades. The percentage of young individuals in the LFL is only half that in the HFL and CFA. In the highest altitudinal range, present day and early 20th century photographs show that the HFL has gained density and has shifted altitudinally upwards, advancing with establishment of new, vigorous outpost trees (13 individuals per each 100 m of tree-line). They are mostly (89\%) younger than 35 yr old and mostly (97\%) located up to 70 m (with a few up to 105 m) ground surface distance above the current tree line (3651 m altitude) at the highest altitudes (16001700 m). The beech forest upward shift is a likely consequence of warming, but land-use practice changes (cessation of burning by shepherds) have made it possible. These changes in vegetation distribution and population structure constitute a new indication of the complex global change effects on life in mountain ecosystems.},

One important test of putative cospeciation events is to verify whether reciprocal speciation is temporally plausible. We explored techniques for double-dating of both plant and insect phylogenies. We use dated molecular phylogenies of a psyllid (Hemiptera)\textendash{}Genisteae (Fabaceae) system, a predominantly monophagous insect\textendash{}plant association widespread on the Atlantic Macaronesian islands. Phylogenetic reconciliation analysis suggests high levels of parallel cladogenesis between legumes and psyllids. However, dating using molecular clocks calibrated on known geological ages of the Macaronesian islands revealed that the legume and psyllid radiations were not contemporaneous but sequential. Whereas the main plant radiation occurred some 8 million years ago, the insect radiation occurred about 3 million years ago. We estimated that {$>$}60\% of the psyllid speciation has resulted from host switching between related hosts. The only evidence for true cospeciation is in the much more recent and localized radiation of genistoid legumes in the Canary Islands, where the psyllid and legume radiations have been partially contemporaneous. The identification of specific cospeciation events over this time period, however, is hindered by the phylogenetic uncertainty in both legume and psyllid phylogenies due to the apparent rapidity of the species radiations.},

  abstract = {The geology and climate of the western Mediterranean area were strongly modified during the Late Tertiary and the Quaternary. These geological and climatic events are thought to have induced changes in the population histories of plants in the Iberian Peninsula. However, fine-scale genetic spatial architecture across western Mediterranean steppe plant refugia has rarely been investigated. A population genetic analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism variation was conducted on present-day, relict populations of Ferula loscosii (Apiaceae). This species exhibits high individual/population numbers in the middle Ebro river valley and, according to the hypothesis of an abundant-centre distribution, these northern populations might represent a long-standing/ancestral distribution centre. However, our results suggest that the decimated southern and central Iberian populations are more variable and structured than the northeastern ones, representing the likely vestiges of an ancestral distribution centre of the species. Phylogeographical analysis suggests that F. loscosii likely originated in southern Spain and then migrated towards the central and northeastern ranges, further supporting a Late Miocene southern-bound Mediterranean migratory way for its oriental steppe ancestors. In addition, different glacial-induced conditions affected the southern and northern steppe Iberian refugia during the Quaternary. The contrasting genetic homogeneity of the Ebro valley range populations compared to the southern Iberian ones possibly reflects more severe bottlenecks and subsequent genetic drift experienced by populations of the northern Iberia refugium during the Pleistocene, followed by successful postglacial expansion from only a few founder plants.},

We highlight the HMM's ability to estimate changes in animals' display effort over time and across different social contexts, using data from male greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Male display effort was modeled across three sites in two experimental treatments (robotic female simulating interested or uninterested behavior) and in the presence or absence of live females. Across contexts, we show that sage grouse males primarily adjust their bout lengths rather than their within-bout display rates. Males' responses to female behavior were correlated with male mating success: males with more matings showed high display persistence regardless of female behavior, while males with fewer matings tended to invest selectively in females that were already showing interest in mating. Additionally, males with higher mating success responded more to the presence of a female than males with fewer matings did. We conclude with suggestions for adapting our HMM approach for use in other animal systems.},

Phases of this process, however, are emerging as highly predictable: the potential geographic course of an invasion can be anticipated with high precision based on the ecological niche characteristics of a species in its native geographic distributional area. This predictivity depends on the premise that ecological niches constitute long-term stable constraints on the potential geographic distributions of species, for which a sizeable body of evidence is accumulating. Hence, although the entire invasion process is indeed complex, the geographic course that invasions are able to take can be anticipated with considerable confidence.},

Location Ecological niche models were developed on the species' native distribu- tional area in South America, and projected globally. Methods We developed ecological niche models based on six different environ- mental data sets, and compared their respective abilities to anticipate the North American invasive distributional area of the species. Results We show that models based on the `bioclimatic variables' of the WorldClim data set indeed fail to predict the full invasive potential of the species, but that models based on four other data sets could predict this potential correctly. Main conclusions The difference in predictive abilities appears to centre on the complexity of the environmental variables involved. These results emphasize important influences of environmental data sets on the generality and ability of ecological niche models to anticipate novel phenomena, and offer a simpler explanation for the lack of predictive ability among native and invaded distributional areas than that of niche shifts.},

In a heterogeneous habitat, decay may occur more quickly in some regions than others: for example, barriers to gene flow can accelerate the genetic differentiation between groups located close in space. We use the concept of "effective migration" to model the relationship between genetics and geography: in this paradigm, effective migration is low in regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We present a method to quantify and visualize variation in effective migration across the habitat, which can be used to identify potential barriers to gene flow, from geographically indexed large-scale genetic data. Our approach uses a population genetic model to relate underlying migration rates to expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities, and estimates migration rates by matching these expectations to the observed dissimilarities. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our method using simulations and data from elephant, human, and Arabidopsis thaliana populations. The resulting visualizations highlight important features of the spatial population structure that are difficult to discern using existing methods for summarizing genetic variation such as principal components analysis.},

Pharmacological therapy is frequently required for acutely treating migraine attacks. The American Academy of Neurology Guidelines published in 2000 summarized the available evidence relating to the efficacy of acute migraine medications. This review, conducted by the members of the Guidelines Section of the American Headache Society, is an updated assessment of evidence for the migraine acute medications. A standardized literature search was performed to identify articles related to acute migraine treatment that were published between 1998 and 2013. The American Academy of Neurology Guidelines Development procedures were followed. Two authors reviewed each abstract resulting from the search and determined whether the full manuscript qualified for review. Two reviewers studied each qualifying full manuscript for its level of evidence. Level A evidence requires at least 2 Class I studies, and Level B evidence requires 1 Class I or 2 Class II studies. The specific medications - triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan [oral, nasal spray, injectable, transcutaneous patch], zolmitriptan [oral and nasal spray]) and dihydroergotamine (nasal spray, inhaler) are effective (Level A). Ergotamine and other forms of dihydroergotamine are probably effective (Level B). Effective nonspecific medications include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen), opioids (butorphanol nasal spray), sumatriptan/naproxen, and the combination of acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine (Level A). Ketoprofen, intravenous and intramuscular ketorolac, flurbiprofen, intravenous magnesium (in migraine with aura), and the combination of isometheptene compounds, codeine/acetaminophen and tramadol/acetaminophen are probably effective (Level B). The antiemetics prochlorperazine, droperidol, chlorpromazine, and metoclopramide are probably effective (Level B). There is inadequate evidence for butalbital and butalbital combinations, phenazone, intravenous tramadol, methadone, butorphanol or meperidine injections, intranasal lidocaine, and corticosteroids, including dexamethasone (Level C). Octreotide is probably not effective (Level B). There is inadequate evidence to refute the efficacy of ketorolac nasal spray, intravenous acetaminophen, chlorpromazine injection, and intravenous granisetron (Level C). There are many acute migraine treatments for which evidence supports efficacy. Clinicians must consider medication efficacy, potential side effects, and potential medication-related adverse events when prescribing acute medications for migraine. Although opioids, such as butorphanol, codeine/acetaminophen, and tramadol/acetaminophen, are probably effective, they are not recommended for regular use.},

  abstract = {Research on bioaerosol is still in its infancy. The dynamics and, therefore, the effects on atmospheric processes and the biosphere are often underestimated, or have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Atmospheric models such as FLEXPART and HYSPLIT enable researchers to simulate the transport of particles in the atmosphere and provide information on where air-parcels originate from. In the following, we present two methods for combining results of these models with spatial information, e.g., about vegetation. The first method shows how spatial CORINE land cover distribution can be analyzed within the boundaries of HYSPLIT trajectories. In a second method, FLEXPART simulations are used in combination with COSMO rain data and tree maps to generate maps that indicate the potential origin of bioaerosol for selected periods of time.},

Here, we use a novel phylogenetic approach to test whether biotic interactions constrain the transition to secondary sympatry following speciation. Applying this temporal framework to a diverse clade of passerine birds (Furnariidae), we reject models of geographic range overlap limited purely by dispersal or environmental constraints, and instead show that rates of secondary sympatry are positively associated with both the phylogenetic and morphological distance between species. Thus, transition rates to sympatry increase with time since divergence and accelerate as the ecological differences between species accumulate. Taken together, these results provide strong empirical evidence that biotic interactions - and primarily ecological competition - limit species distributions across large spatial and temporal scales. They also offer phylogenetic and trait-based metrics by which these interactions can be incorporated into ecological forecasting models.},

  abstract = {Periodic predator-prey dynamics in constant environments are usually taken as indicative of deterministic limit cycles. It is known, however, that demographic stochasticity in finite populations can also give rise to regular population cycles, even when the corresponding deterministic models predict a stable equilibrium. Specifically, such quasi-cycles are expected in stochastic versions of deterministic models exhibiting equilibrium dynamics with weakly damped oscillations. The existence of quasi-cycles substantially expands the scope for natural patterns of periodic population oscillations caused by ecological interactions, thereby complicating the conclusive interpretation of such patterns. Here we show how to distinguish between quasi-cycles and noisy limit cycles based on observing changing population sizes in predator-prey populations. We start by confirming that both types of cycle can occur in the individual-based version of a widely used class of deterministic predator-prey model. We then show that it is feasible and straightforward to accurately distinguish between the two types of cycle through the combined analysis of autocorrelations and marginal distributions of population sizes. Finally, by confronting these results with real ecological time series, we demonstrate that by using our methods even short and imperfect time series allow quasi-cycles and limit cycles to be distinguished reliably.},

Comparison of gene flow rates among populations characterized by different management and evolutionary histories allows one to decipher the role of factors such as isolation and tree density on gene movements. We used two paternity analysis approaches and different strategies to handle the possible presence of genotyping errors to obtain robust estimates of pollen flow in four European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations from Austria and France. In each country one of the two plots is located in an unmanaged forest; the other plots are managed with a shelterwood system and inside a colonization area (in Austria and France, respectively). The two paternity analysis approaches provided almost identical estimates of gene flow. In general, we found high pollen immigration (\textasciitilde{}75\% of pollen from outside), with the exception of the plot from a highly isolated forest remnant (\textasciitilde{}50\%). In the two unmanaged plots, the average within-population pollen dispersal distances (from 80 to 184 m) were higher than previously estimated for beech. From the comparison between the Austrian managed and unmanaged plots, that are only 500 m apart, we found no evidence that either gene flow or reproductive success distributions were significantly altered by forest management. The investigated phenotypic traits (crown area, height, diameter and flowering phenology) were not significantly related with male reproductive success. Shelterwood seems to have an effect on the distribution of within-population pollen dispersal distances. In the managed plot, pollen dispersal distances were shorter, possibly because adult tree density is three-fold (163 versus 57 trees per hectare) with respect to the unmanaged one.},

Here we extend previous analyses with a static optimum to allow the environment to vary in time as well as in space. The model follows both population dynamics and the trait mean under stabilizing selection, and the outcomes can be understood by comparing the loads due to genetic variance, dispersal, and temporal change. With fixed genetic variance, we obtain two regimes: (1) adaptation that is uniform along the environmental gradient and that responds to the moving optimum as expected for panmictic populations and when the spatial gradient is sufficiently steep, and (2) a population with limited range that adapts more slowly than the environmental optimum changes in both time and space; the population therefore becomes locally extinct and migrates toward suitable habitat. We also use a population-genetic model with many loci to allow genetic variance to evolve, and we show that the only solution now has uniform adaptation.},

  abstract = {Why do species not adapt to ever-wider ranges of conditions, gradually expanding their ecological niche and geographic range? Gene flow across environments has two conflicting effects: although it increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that, when the environment varies across space, ``swamping'' by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp range margin. However, current deterministic theory shows that, when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate a sharp margin to a species' range, by reducing genetic variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: (i) the effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment; and (ii) the efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts sharp range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes in the environment. Furthermore, it implies that gradual worsening of conditions across a species' habitat may lead to a sudden range fragmentation, when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a single species becomes impossible.},

Conclusions 937 Acknowledgements 937 References 937 Summary Leafing-out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf-out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf-out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf-out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf-out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf-out will affect carbon sequestration, plant\textendash{}animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf-out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf-out timing. For most species, onset of leaf-out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset.},

The biota include 174 species of vascular plants, 138 species of vertebrates, more than 55 species of arachnids, and an unknown (but great) number of microorganisms, insects (2,000-3,000 estimated species), acari, and nematodes. Trophic relations are presented in a series of nested subwebs and delineations of the community. Complexity arises from the large number of interactive species, the frequency of omnivory, age structure, looping, the lack of compartmentalization, and the complexity of the arthropod and soil faunas. Web features found in the Coachella also characterize other communities and should produce equivalently complex webs. If anything, diversity and complexity in most nondesert habitats are greater than those in deserts. Patterns from the Coachella web are compared with theoretical predictions and "empirical generalizations" derived from catalogs of published webs. The Coachella web differs greatly: chains are longer, omnivory and loops are not rare, connectivity is greater (species interact with many more predators and prey), top predators are rare or nonexistent, and prey-to-predator ratios are greater than 1.0. The evidence argues that actual community food webs are extraordinarily more complex than those webs cataloged by theorists. I argue that most cataloged webs are oversimplified caricatures of actual communities. That cataloged webs depict so few species, absurdly low ratios of predators on prey and prey eaten by predators, so few links, so little omnivory, a veritable absence of looping, and such a high proportion of top predators argues strongly that they poorly represent real biological communities. Consequently, the practice of abstracting empirical regularities from such catalogs yields an inaccurate and artifactual view of trophic interactions within communities. Contrary to strong assertions by many theorists, patterns from food webs of real communities generally do not support predictions arising from dynamic and graphic models of food-web structure.},

However, after decades of model comparison there remains no consensus model to predict the date of spring phenological events in perennial temperate trees across species and locations. This lack of consensus may be due to over-fitting resulting from high model complexity, use of parameters that have not been adequately validated, or omission of parameters that are sound biological indicators of dormancy breaking. The aim of this study was to construct spring phenology candidate models with biologically-based parameters and starting values to test hypotheses regarding chill accumulation duration and the impact of pre-bloom conditions. Bloom data for three cultivars of Prunus dulcis (almond) from three decades in California were analyzed. Across all three cultivars, models which accumulated chill until approximately 75\% of the heat requirement had been met, and did not integrate pre-bloom conditions, were substantially supported by the data. This suggests cold temperatures affect dormancy breaking well after the chilling requirement has been met and bud break timing is not substantially impacted by environmental conditions just prior to bud break. Fitting spring phenology using biologically based starting values estimated from bud break records may allow for the development of improved predictive models and improved approximations of critical phenological thresholds. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Scientists and managers from throughout the United States Forest Service have cooperated to develop a framework for conservation priority-setting assessments of forest tree species. This framework uses trait data and predictions of expected climate change pressure to categorize and prioritize 339 native tree species for conservation, monitoring, management and restoration across all forested lands in the contiguous United States and Alaska. The framework allows for the quantitative grouping of species into vulnerability classes that may require different management and conservation strategies for maintaining the adaptive genetic variation of the species within each group. This categorization is based on risk factors relating to the species' (1) exposure to climate change, (2) sensitivity to climate change, and (3) capacity to adapt to climate change. We used K-means clustering to group species into seven classes based on these three vulnerability dimensions. The most vulnerable class encompassed 35 species with high scores for all three vulnerability dimensions. These will require the most immediate conservation intervention. A group of 43 species had high exposure and sensitivity, probably requiring conservation assistance, while a group of 69 species had high exposure and low adaptive capacity, probably needing close monitoring. This assessment tool should be valuable for scientists and managers determining which species and populations to target for monitoring efforts and for pro-active gene conservation and management activities.},

  abstract = {Giant tortoises, a prominent symbol of the Galapagos archipelago, illustrate the influence of geological history and natural selection on the diversification of organisms. Because of heavy human exploitation, 4 of the 15 known species (Geochelone spp.) have disappeared. Charles Darwin himself detailed the intense harvesting of one species, G. elephantopus, which once was endemic to the island of Floreana. This species was believed to have been exterminated within 15 years of Darwin's historic visit to the Galapagos in 1835. The application of modern DNA techniques to museum specimens combined with long-term study of a system creates new opportunities for identifying the living remnants of extinct taxa in the wild. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data obtained from museum specimens to show that the population on Floreana was evolutionarily distinct from all other Galapagos tortoise populations. It was demonstrated that some living individuals on the nearby island of Isabela are genetically distinct from the rest of the island's inhabitants. Surprisingly, we found that these "non-native" tortoises from Isabela are of recent Floreana ancestry and closely match the genetic data provided by the museum specimens. Thus, we show that the genetic line of G. elephantopus has not been completely extinguished and still exists in an intermixed population on Isabela. With enough individuals to commence a serious captive breeding program, this finding may help reestablish a species that was thought to have gone extinct more than a century ago and illustrates the power of long-term genetic analysis and the critical role of museum specimens in conservation biology.},

This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis.

References SUMMARY: Conifers have been understudied at the genomic level despite their worldwide ecological and economic importance but the situation is rapidly changing with the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. With NGS, genomics research has simultaneously gained in speed, magnitude and scope. In just a few years, genomes of 20-24 gigabases have been sequenced for several conifers, with several others expected in the near future. Biological insights have resulted from recent sequencing initiatives as well as genetic mapping, gene expression profiling and gene discovery research over nearly two decades. We review the knowledge arising from conifer genomics research emphasizing genome evolution and the genomic basis of adaptation, and outline emerging questions and knowledge gaps. We discuss future directions in three areas with potential inputs from NGS technologies: the evolutionary impacts of adaptation in conifers based on the adaptation-by-speciation model; the contributions of genetic variability of gene expression in adaptation; and the development of a broader understanding of genetic diversity and its impacts on genome function. These research directions promise to sustain research aimed at addressing the emerging challenges of adaptation that face conifer trees.},

Using the timing of male inflorescence development, 57 plus trees represented by their clones in a seed orchard were classified into three phenological groups: ear - ly-, intermediate-, and late-flowering. The microsatellites showed no significant differences in the genetic structure of the analyzed phenological groups. However, the frequency of allele 2 at the shikimate dehy- drogenase A locus (ShDH A 2) differed significantly between the groups of early- and late-flowering trees and between the groups of intermediate- and late-flowering trees. In addition, a significant difference in the frequencies of the genotype ShDH A 11 was observed between the intermediate- and late-flowering groups. Nei's genetic distance indicated that the late-flowering group was the most genetically distant among the phenological groups. These results suggest that the ShDH A locus might be considered as isoenzymatic marker that differentiates these flowering groups of Scots pine clones. At several isozyme and DNA loci, the presence of private alleles in each group of pines was observed. However, these alleles cannot serve as markers of Scots pine flowering time because of their low frequencies.},

Here we show that pollen of different species strongly differ in their ice nucleation behaviour. The average freezing temperatures in laboratory experiments range from 240 to 255 K. As the most efficient nuclei (silver birch, Scots pine and common juniper pollen) have a distribution area up to the Northern timberline, their ice nucleation activity might be a cryoprotective mechanism. Far more intriguingly, it has turned out that water, which has been in contact with pollen and then been separated from the bodies, nucleates as good as the pollen grains themselves. The ice nuclei have to be easily-suspendable macromolecules located on the pollen. Once extracted, they can be distributed further through the atmosphere than the heavy pollen grains and so presumably augment the impact of pollen on ice cloud formation even in the upper troposphere. Our experiments lead to the conclu- sion that pollen ice nuclei, in contrast to bacterial and fungal ice nucleating proteins, are non-proteinaceous compounds},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The total amount of native vegetation is an important property of fragmented landscapes and is known to exert a strong influence on population and metapopulation dynamics. As the relationship between habitat loss and local patch and gap characteristics is strongly non-linear, theoretical models predict that immigration rates should decrease dramatically at low levels of remaining native vegetation cover, leading to patch-area effects and the existence of species extinction thresholds across fragmented landscapes with different proportions of remaining native vegetation. Although empirical patterns of species distribution and richness give support to these models, direct measurements of immigration rates across fragmented landscapes are still lacking.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the Brazilian Atlantic forest marsupial Gray Slender Mouse Opossum (Marmosops incanus) as a model species and estimating demographic parameters of populations in patches situated in three landscapes differing in the total amount of remaining forest, we tested the hypotheses that patch-area effects on population density are apparent only at intermediate levels of forest cover, and that immigration rates into forest patches are defined primarily by landscape context surrounding patches. As expected, we observed a positive patch-area effect on M. incanus density only within the landscape with intermediate forest cover. Density was independent of patch size in the most forested landscape and the species was absent from the most deforested landscape. Specifically, the mean estimated numbers of immigrants into small patches were lower in the landscape with intermediate forest cover compared to the most forested landscape.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results reveal the crucial importance of the total amount of remaining native vegetation for species persistence in fragmented landscapes, and specifically as to the role of variable immigration rates in providing the underlying mechanism that drives both patch-area effects and species extinction thresholds.},

Its patterns of adaptive variation and role in forest economic and ecological systems have been studied extensively for nearly 275 years, detailed demography for a 100 years and mating system more than 50 years. However, its reference genome sequence is not yet available and genomic studies have been lagging compared to e.g. Pinus taeda and Picea abies, two other economically important conifers. Despite the lack of reference genome, many modern genomic methods are applicable for a more detailed look at its biological characteristics. For example, RNA-seq has revealed a complex transcriptional landscape and targeted DNA sequencing displays an excess of rare variants and geographically homogenously distributed molecular genetic diversity. Current DNA and RNA resources can be used as a reference for gene expression studies, SNP discovery and further targeted sequencing. In the future, specific consequences of the large genome size, such as functional effects of regulatory open chromatin regions and transposable elements should be investigated more carefully. For forest breeding and long-term management purposes, genomic data can help in assessing the genetic basis of inbreeding depression and application of genomic tools for genomic prediction and relatedness estimates. Given the challenges of breeding (long generation time, no easy vegetative propagation) and the economic importance, application of genomic tools has potential to have a considerable impact. Here we explore how genomic characteristics of P. sylvestris, such as rare alleles and the low extent of linkage disequilibrium, impact the applicability and power of the tools.},

Yet only one result, Fisher's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. I argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher's average-excess equation, Robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder's equation, and Fisher's fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.},

We find their diversity loss was not just a consequence of "gamblers ruin" but resulted from the evolutionary loss to the Red Queen, a failure to keep pace with a deteriorating environment. Diversity loss is driven equally by both depressed origination rates and elevated extinction rates. Although we find diversity-dependent origination and extinction rates, the diversity of each clade only transiently equaled the implied equilibrium diversity. Thus, the processes that drove diversity loss in terrestrial mammal clades were fundamentally nonequilibrial and overwhelmed diversity-dependent processes.},

Technological advances in recent years should now allow us to answer many long-standing questions about the nature of adaptation. The data gathered so far are beginning to challenge some widespread views of the way in which natural selection operates at the genomic level. Papers in this Special Feature of Proceedings of the Royal Society B illustrate various aspects of the broad field of adaptation genomics. This introductory article sets up a context and, on the basis of a few selected examples, discusses how genomic data can advance our understanding of the process of adaptation.},

  abstract = {Warming climate has increased access of native bark beetles to high-elevation pines that historically received only intermittent exposure to these tree-killing herbivores. Here we show that a dominant, relatively na{\"i}ve, high-elevation species, whitebark pine, has inferior defenses against mountain pine beetle compared with its historical lower-elevation host, lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pines respond by exuding more resin and accumulating higher concentrations of toxic monoterpenes than whitebark pine, where they co-occur. Furthermore, the chemical composition of whitebark pine appears less able to inhibit the pheromonal communication beetles use to jointly overcome tree defenses. Despite whitebark pine's inferior defenses, beetles were more likely to attack their historical host in mixed stands. This finding suggests there has been insufficient sustained contact for beetles to alter their complex behavioral mechanisms driving host preference. In no-choice assays, however, beetles readily entered and tunneled in both hosts equally, and in stands containing less lodgepole pine, attacks on whitebark pines increased. High-elevation trees in pure stands may thus be particularly vulnerable to temperature-driven range expansions. Predators and competitors were more attracted to volatiles from herbivores attacking their historical host, further increasing risk in less coevolved systems. Our results suggest cold temperatures provided a sufficient barrier against herbivores for high-elevation trees to allocate resources to other physiological processes besides defense. Changing climate may reduce the viability of that evolutionary strategy, and the life histories of high-elevation trees seem unlikely to foster rapid counter adaptation. Consequences extend from reduced food supplies for endangered grizzly bears to altered landscape and hydrological processes.},

  abstract = {Our models for detecting the effect of adaptation on population genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a "soft" sweep). Here we study models of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can allow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow dramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by a single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the strength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict, as more data becomes available, many more examples of intra-species parallel adaptation will be uncovered.},

Geographic variables accounted for as much as 34\% of the variance among Rocky Mountain populations. Patterns of genetic variation were dominated by the effects of latitude and elevation, with populations from the north and from high elevations having the lowest growth potential, the least tolerance to the needle cast, and the lowest survival. However, the slope of the geographic clines was relatively flat. Populations in the same geographic area, for instance, need to be separated by about 500 m in elevation before genetic differentiation can be expected. Regression models using geographic predictors were developed to describe variation in ten climatic variables from 192 weather stations that best represented the Rocky Mountain distribution of L. occidentalis. Values of R2ranged from 0.42 to 0.92 and were higher for temperature than for precipitation variables. Using climatic effects predicted for each provenance to describe genetic variation produced values of R2between 0.15 and 0.27 which accounted for nearly as much (68-100\%) of the genetic variance as had geographic variables. The analyses suggested that genetic differentiation was controlled primarily by the relative mildness of the climate.

Novel 2, 4-diamino-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines are potent inhibitors of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, are cytoprotective in cell culture models of oxidative injury, and are neuroprotective in brain injury and ischemia models. The selection of lead candidates from this series required that they reach target cells deep within brain tissue in efficacious amounts after oral dosing. A homologous series of 26 highly lipophilic pyrrolopyrimidines was examined using cultured cell monolayers to understand the structure-permeability relationship and to use this information to predict brain penetration and residence time. Pyrrolopyrimidines were shown to be a more permeable structural class of membrane-interactive antioxidants where transepithelial permeability was inversely related to lipophilicity or to cell partitioning. Pyrrole substitutions influence cell partitioning where bulky hydrophobic groups increased partitioning and decreased permeability and smaller hydrophobic groups and more hydrophilic groups, especially those capable of weak hydrogen bonding, decreased partitioning, and increased permeability. Transmonolayer diffusion for these membrane-interactive antioxidants was limited mostly by desorption from the receiver-side membrane into the buffer. Thus, in this case, these in vitro cell monolayer models do not adequately mimic the in vivo situation by underestimating in vivo bioavailability of highly lipophilic compounds unless acceptors, such as serum proteins, are added to the receiving buffer.},

Impact was considered according to the transient effects of a changing climate governed by (1) physiological plasticity in the contemporary generation and (2) long-term evolutionary adjustments that provide adaptedness and optimize productivity in future generations.

  abstract = {The availability of climate data and sophisticated software for high speed computers has made it possible to assess the climatic factors underlying geographic patterns of genetic variation in forest trees. Analyses have demonstrated anew that the clines in genetic variation that typify most tree species indeed have been molded by and are perpetuated by the climate. Yet, distribution of genotypes across the landscape is controlled by an interaction between adaptation to climate and competition, the same factors governing the distribution of species. Genotypes occur where they can be competitively exclusive, but most, nonetheless, have been competitively excluded from their climatic optima. Most populations, therefore, exist in climates that are colder than the optimal for their growth, productivity, and survival, with the discrepancy between the inhabited and the optimal climate increasing with the severity of the climate. Responses to climate change can be viewed (1) as short-term plastic responses that accrue in endemic populations as physiological systems adjust to change, and (2) as long-term evolutionary processes that realign genetic variability with environmental diversity. Immediate short-term responses to a warming climate are dependent on the discrepancy between the inhabited and optimal climates. Responses, therefore, should be highly negative in populations occupying the mildest climates but positive in the coldest. As a result, expected short-term responses in Pinus sylvestris and Larix sibirica of Siberia are strongly positive while those of Picea engelmannii of western United States are highly negative. Accommodating global warming in the long term will require a redistribution of genotypes within species to match genotypes with the climate for which they are best suited. The process undoubtedly will be driven by migration, gene flow, and selection. Natural processes, however, tend to occur at rates too slow to match the projected speed of global warming. Without the intervention of mankind in the evolutionary processes, accommodating the warming expected by 2100 may require many centuries.},

  abstract = {The Random Forests multiple-regression tree was used to model climate profiles of 25 biotic communities of the western United States and nine of their constituent species. Analyses of the communities were based on a gridded sample of ca. 140,000 points, while those for the species used presence-absence data from ca. 120,000 locations. Independent variables included 35 simple expressions of temperature and precipitation and their interactions. Classification errors for community models averaged 19\%, but the errors were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data sets. Errors of omission for species-specific models approached 0, while errors of commission were less than 9\%. Mapped climate profiles of the species were in solid agreement with range maps. Climate variables of most importance for segregating the communities were those that generally differentiate maritime, continental, and monsoonal climates, while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of species varied among species but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interactions. Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profiles at the expense largely of those of the subalpine, alpine, and tundra communities but also that of the arid woodlands. However, the climate of 47\% of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profiles. Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profiles were varied, but shifts in space and attitude would be extensive. Species-specific projections were not necessarily consistent with those of their communities.},

Regeneration strategies are considered with the goal of matching growth potential of contemporary populations to the future climate where that potential can be realized.

Seedlings from 104 natural populations of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and 10 blue spruce (Picea pungens) populations from the Intermountain West, U.S.A., were compared in common gardens. Comparisons involved 16 characters that described growth, development, and cold hardiness plus nine monoterpenes. Canonical discriminant analyses detected one population of blue spruce that had been misidentified, readily separated populations of blue and Engelmann spruce, suggested that three Southwest populations differed markedly from Intermountain populations of Engelmann spruce, but identified no Intermountain populations that reflected introgression with blue spruce. Genetic differences were detected among populations of Engelmann spruce for 16 of the morphometric characters, and multiple regression models accounted for as much as 70\% of the variance among populations. The regressions described genetic variation occurring along clines that were dominated by elevational and latitudinal effects. The slope of the clines, however, was relatively gentle; populations located within the same physiographic province must be separated by at least 420 m in elevation before genetic differentiation becomes a reasonable possibility. By providing a means for assessing the degree by which similar genotypes recur across the landscape, the regression models have direct practical application in programs ranging from land management to conservation biology.},

The rodents excavate vast burrow systems and deposit tailings in abandoned tunnels and on the ground surface. Energetic costs of excavations are extremely high, placing a premium on optimizing the location of burrows. The resulting disturbance patterns alter physical and biotic processes fundamentally. Recent studies reveal that the extensive excavations and their associated impacts generate a dynamic mosaic of nutrients and soil conditions that promotes diversity and maintains disturbance-dependent components of plant communities. Furthermore, these disturbances significantly accelerate erosion and downslope soil movement on shallow slopes and inhibit them on steep slopes.},

To date, more than 550,000 spruce expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been publically deposited, most of which were constructed from various tissue collected during active primary growth. Here we report EST sequencing of dormant foliage and bud tissue collected from Sitka spruce. Both normalized and standard libraries were employed, with tissue collected at two autumn time points. A total of 30,681 ESTs were generated then assembled into 9,400 putative unique transcripts, or unigenes, with an average length of 779 bp. These autumn specific Sitka spruce ESTs were combined with autumn specific white spruce ESTs and compared with all spruce ESTs currently available. In total, 12,307 ESTs were unique to the autumn libraries, which assembled into 11,121 unigenes. Functional categorization suggests a role for some of these genes in bud dormancy and adaptation to freezing stress. Our results show that dormant tissue harbours a large number of transcripts not found in the same tissue during the growing season, and this sequence resource will therefore support ongoing studies of adaptive traits in spruce. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Landscape pattern indices (LPI), which characterize various aspects of composition and configuration of categorical variables on a lattice (e.g., shape, clumping, proportion), have become increasingly popular for quantifying and characterizing various aspects of spatial patterns. Unlike in the case of spatial statistical models, when either the joint distribution of all values is characterized by a limited number of parameters, or the distribution is known for certain (usually random) cases, the distributions of LPI are not known. Therefore, comparisons of LPI or significance testing of differences among various landscapes and/or studies are uncertain. This paper scrutinizes six widely used LPI, which are computed based on categories mapped onto regular lattices. We designed a simulation using Gauss-Markov random fields to establish the empirical distributions of LPI as functions of landscape composition and configuration. We report the results for stationary binary landscapes. The confidence intervals for LPI are derived based on 1000 simulations of each given combination of parameters, and further details are evaluated for three illustrative cases. We report the distributions of the LPI along with their co-variation. Our results elucidate how proportion of cover classes and spatial autocorrelation simultaneously and significantly affect the outcome of LPI values. These results also highlight the importance and formal linkages between fully specified spatial stochastic models and spatial pattern analysis. We conclude that LPI must be compared with great care because of the drastic effects that both composition and configuration have on individual LPI values. We also stress the importance of knowing the expected range of variation about LPI values so that statistical comparisons and inferences can be made.},

Our frameworks are based on conditional autoregressive simulations to derive empirical distributions for each metric where composition and configuration parameters are controlled.

We also provide means for situating any landscape on a selected pattern metric-surface defined by parameters of composition and configuration. These surfaces illustrate which parameter would be most easily adjusted to effect a desired change in a selected class-focused pattern metric's value.

  abstract = {In the next century, global climate change is predicted to have large influences on species' distributions. Much of the research in this area has focused on predicting the areas where conditions will be suitable for the species in future, and thus the potential distribution of the species. However, it is equally important to predict the relative abilities of species to migrate into new suitable areas as conditions shift, while accounting for dynamic processes, such as dispersal, maturation, mortality, and reproduction, as well as landscape characteristics, such as level of habitat fragmentation and connectivity. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit individual-based model that addresses these factors. As a motivating case study, we based aspects of the model on southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, but stress that the results obtained are generalizable beyond this region. Using the model, we enhanced current understanding of climate change impacts by investigating how and to what extent the functional traits of plant species affect their ability to move with climate change across landscapes with various levels of fragmentation. We also tested the efficacy of strategic restoration, such as planting corridors to increase connectivity among fragments. We found that even if the landscape is fully intact, only an average of 34.2\% of all simulated functional groups had a good chance of successfully tracking climate change. However, our study highlights the power of strategic restoration as a tool for increasing species persistence. Corridors linking fragments increased species persistence rates by up to 24\%. The lowest persistence rates were found for trees, a functional group with high dispersal but also long generation times. Our results indicate that for trees intervention techniques, such as assisted migration might be required to prevent species losses.},

Nevertheless, we know little about whether this variation results from differential perception of SDs or differential downstream responses to the SD signal or a combination of the two. We compared global patterns of SD-regulated gene expression in the stems of hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa \texttimes{} Populus deltoides) clones that differ in their SD-induced growth cessation in order to address this question. The timing of cessation of cambial cell division caused by SDs differed between the clones and was coincident with the change in the pattern of expression of the auxin-regulated genes. The clones also differed in the timing of their SD-regulated changes in the transcript abundance of genes associated with cold tolerance, starch breakdown, and storage protein accumulation. By analyzing the expression of homologs of FLOWERING LOCUS T, we demonstrated that the clones differed little in their perception of SDs under the growth conditions applied but differed substantially in the downstream responses manifested in the timing and magnitude of gene expression after SD treatment. These results demonstrate the existence of factors that act downstream of SD perception and can contribute to variation in SD-regulated adaptive photoperiodic responses in trees.},

Inverse terminal velocity (Vt(-1)) of field-collected achenes was used as a proxy for individual seed dispersal ability. We related this measure to different metrics of landscape connectivity, at two spatial scales: in a detailed analysis of eight landscapes in Spain and along a latitudinal gradient using 29 landscapes across three European regions. In the highly patchy Spanish landscapes, seed Vt(-1)increased significantly with increasing connectivity. A common garden experiment suggested that differences in Vt(-1) may be in part genetically based. The Vt(-1) was also found to increase with landscape occupancy, a coarser measure of connectivity, on a much broader (European) scale. Finally, Vt(-1)was found to increase along a south-north latitudinal gradient. Our results for M. muralis are consistent with 'Darwin's wind dispersal hypothesis' that high cost of dispersal may select for lower dispersal ability in fragmented landscapes, as well as with the 'leading edge hypothesis' that most recently colonized populations harbour more dispersive phenotypes.},

However, little of this research has explored variation at microgeographic scales because it has often been assumed that high rates of gene flow will prevent adaptive divergence at fine spatial scales. Here, we establish a quantitative definition of microgeographic adaptation based on Wright's dispersal neighborhood that standardizes dispersal abilities, enabling this measure to be compared across species. We use this definition to evaluate growing evidence of evolutionary divergence at fine spatial scales. We identify the main mechanisms known to facilitate this adaptation and highlight illustrative examples of microgeographic evolution in nature. Collectively, this evidence requires that we revisit our understanding of the spatial scale of adaptation and consider how microgeographic adaptation and its driving mechanisms can fundamentally alter ecological and evolutionary dynamics in nature. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results confirm that relatively frequent partial harvesting dominates the logging regimes, but with significant variation among different parts of the region and different forest types.

We apply it to the devastating banana pest Mycosphaerella fijiensis, a wind-dispersed fungus for which a secondary contact zone had previously been detected using landscape genetics tools. By tracking the spatio-temporal frequency change of 15 microsatellite markers, we find that {$\sigma$}, the standard deviation of parent-offspring dispersal distances, is 1.2~km/generation(1/2) . The analysis is further shown robust to a large range of dispersal kernels. We conclude that combining landscape genetics approaches to detect breaks in allelic frequencies with analyses of changes in neutral genetic clines offers a powerful way to obtain ecologically relevant estimates of dispersal in many species.},

  abstract = {Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar = 8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range = 6.49\textendash{}7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (FST = 0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean FST = 0.01 {$\pm$} 0.01; n = 16 P = 0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (rp = 0.06\textendash{}0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances ({$<$} 1.7 km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.},

Specifically, we ask: (1) do climate conditions with no modern analogue negatively affect the accuracy of ecosystem reconstructions? (2) are bioclimate envelope model projections biased towards under-predicting forested ecosystems? (3) given a palaeoecological perspective, are potential habitat projections for the 21st century within model capabilities? Location Western North America. Methods We used an ensemble classifier modelling approach (RandomForest) to spatially project the climate space of modern ecosystem classes throughout the Holocene (at 6000, 9000, 11,000, 14,000, 16,000, and 21,000 YBP) using palaeoclimate surfaces generated by two general circulation models (GFDL and CCM1). The degree of novel arrangement of climate variables was quantified with the multivariate Mahalanobis distance to the nearest modern climatic equivalent. Model projections were validated against biome classifications inferred from 1460 palaeoecological records. Results Model accuracy assessed against independent palaeoecology data is generally low for the present day, increases for 6000 YBP, and then rapidly declines towards the last glacial maximum, primarily due to the under-prediction of forested biomes. Misclassifications were closely correlated with the degree of climate dissimilarity from the present day. For future projections, no-analogue climates unexpectedly emerged in the coastal Pacific Northwest but were absent throughout the rest of the study area. Main conclusions Bioclimate envelope models could approximately reconstruct ecosystem distributions for the mid- to late-Holocene but proved unreliable in the Late Pleistocene. We attribute this failure to a combination of no-analogue climates and a potential lack of niche conservatism in tree species. However, climate dissimilarities in future projections are comparatively minor (similar to those of the mid-Holocene), and we conclude that no-analogue climates should not compromise the accuracy of model predictions for the next century.},

  abstract = {On raised bogs, the distribution of Sphagnum species is determined by their distance to the water table, but occasionally species are able to survive outside their niche. Hollow species that persist in hummock vegetation are assumed to profit from the higher water content of the surrounding hummock species, although the mechanism responsible is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the role of lateral hummock water transport (LHWT) and precipitation on the water content of hollow species occurring in hummocks. This was tested using a full factorial field transplantation experiment with cores of Sphagnum cuspidatum in a high and a low hummock. Treatments included direct precipitation (present or absent) and LHWT (present or absent). Fresh weights of the cores were measured at regular time intervals. Our results show a relatively large effect of precipitation on the water content in both the high and low hummock, whereas LHWT only seemed to be an important source of water in the high hummock, which was relatively dry. Furthermore, LHWT played an important role only after large precipitation events, suggesting that lateral water transport is indirectly affected by rain. This study shows that precipitation alone can explain the persistence of hollow species in high hummocks, whereas it was less important for hollow species in low hummocks. Our data suggest that the survival and potential expansion of hollow species in higher hummocks strongly depends on the intensity and frequency of rain events. Changes in precipitation patterns may result in a loss of Sphagnum diversity in hummocks.},

However, the application of suitable models that account for the specific dendritic structure of hydrographic networks is still incipient in the literature. We investigate the roles of ecological and spatial factors in driving the genetic diversity of Salix salviifolia, an Iberian endemic riparian tree, across the species latitudinal range. We applied spatial stream-network models that aptly integrate dendritic features (topology, directionality) to quantify the impacts of multiple scale factors in determining genetic diversity. Based on the drift hypothesis, we expect that genetic diversity accumulates downstream in riparian ecosystems, but life history traits (e.g. dispersal patterns) and abiotic or anthropogenic factors (e.g. drought events or hydrological alteration) might alter expected patterns. Hydrological factors explained the downstream accumulation of genetic diversity at the intermediate scale that was likely mediated by hydrochory. The models also suggested upstream gene flow within basins that likely occurred through anemophilous and entomophilous pollen and seed dispersal. Higher thermicity and summer drought were related to higher population inbreeding and individual homozygosity, respectively, suggesting that increased aridity might disrupt the connectivity and mating patterns among and within riparian populations.},

Photosynthesis increases, more plant biomass accumulates per unit of water consumed, and economic yield is enhanced The profitable use of supplemental C02 over years of greenhouse practice points to the value of C02 for plant production. Plant responses to CO, are known to interact with other environmental factors, e.g. light, temperature, soil water, and humidity. Important stresses including drought, temperature, salinity, and air pollution have been shown to be ameliorated when CO2 levels are elevated In the agricultural context, the growing season has been shortened for some crops with the application of more C02; less water use has generally, but not always, been observed and is under further study; experimental studies have shown that economic yield for most crops increases by about 33\% for a doubling of ambient C02 concentration. However, there are some reports of negligible or negative effects. Plant species respond differently to C02 enrichment, therefore, clearly competitive shifts within natural communities could occur. Though of less importance in managed agro-ecosystems, competition between crops and weeds could also be altered. Tissue composition can vary as C02 increases (e.g. higher C: N ratios) leading to changes in herbivory, but tests of crop products (consumed by man) from elevated C02 experiments have generally not revealed significant differences in their quality. However, any C02-induced change in plant chemical or structural make-up could lead to alterations in the plant's interaction with any number of environmental factors--physicochemieal or biological. Host-pathogen relationships, defense against physical stressors, and the capacity to overcome resource shortages could be impacted by rises in C02. Root biomass is known to increase but, with few exceptions, detailed studies of root growth and function are lacking.},

Much of the information was obtained from "The Effects of Nuclear Weapons" by Glasstone and Dolan (1977). The model was evaluated against the measurements of nuclear fallout from six nuclear tests conducted between 1951 and 1957 at the Nevada Test Site using the global NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project (NNRP) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological data as input. The model was able to reproduce the general direction and deposition patterns using the coarse NNRP data with Figureof Merit in Space (FMS - the percent overlap between predicted and measured deposition patterns) scores in excess of 50\% for four of six simulations for the smallest dose rate contour, with FMS scores declining for higher dose rate contours. When WRF meteorological data were used the FMS scores were 5-20\% higher in five of the six simulations, especially at the higher dose rate contours. The one WRF simulation where the scores declined slightly (10-30\%) was also the best scoring simulation when using the NNRP data. When compared with measurements of dose rate and time of arrival from the Town Data Base (Thompson etal., 1994), similar results were found with the WRF simulations providing better results for four of six simulations. The overall result was that the different plume simulations using WRF data had more consistent performance than the plume simulations using NNRP data fields. \textcopyright{} 2014.},

We tested this prediction by means of a large and replicated mark-recapture study of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in two stream populations. One of the populations (outlet) experiences high gene flow from the lake population and its morphology is correspondingly poorly adapted. The other population (inlet) experiences very low gene flow from the lake population and its morphology is correspondingly well adapted. Contrary to the above prediction, selection was not stronger in the outlet than in the inlet, a result that forced us to consider potential reasons for why maladaptive gene flow might not increase selection. Of particular interest, we show by means of a simple population genetic model that maladaptive gene flow can\textemdash{}under reasonable conditions\textemdash{}decrease the strength of directional selection. This outcome occurs when immigrants decrease mean fitness in the resident population, which decreases the strength of selection against maladapted phenotypes.

  abstract = {Despite abundant empirical evidence that inbreeding depression varies with both the environment and the genotypic context, theoretical predictions about such effects are still rare. Using a quantitative genetics model, we predict amounts of inbreeding depression for fitness emerging from Gaussian stabilizing selection on some phenotypic trait, on which, for simplicity, genetic effects are strictly additive. Given the strength of stabilizing selection, inbreeding depression then varies simply with the genetic variance for the trait under selection and the distance between the mean breeding value and the optimal phenotype. This allows us to relate the expected inbreeding depression to the degree of maladaptation of the population to its environment. We confront analytical predictions with simulations, in well-adapted populations at equilibrium, as well as in maladapted populations undergoing either a transient environmental shift, or gene swamping in heterogeneous habitats. We predict minimal inbreeding depression in situations of extreme maladaptation. Our model provides a new basis for interpreting experiments that measure inbreeding depression for the same set of genotypes in different environments, by demonstrating that the history of adaptation, in addition to environmental harshness per se, may account for differences in inbreeding depression.},

  abstract = {Most theoretical models for the evolution of senescence have assumed a very large, well mixed population. Here, we investigate how limited dispersal and kin competition might influence the evolution of ageing by deriving indicators of the force of selection, similar to Hamilton (Hamilton 1966 J. Theor. Biol. 12, 12-45). Our analytical model describes how the strength of selection on survival and fecundity changes with age in a patchy population, where adults are territorial and a fraction of juveniles disperse between territories. Both parent-offspring competition and sib competition then affect selection on age-specific life-history traits. Kin competition reduces the strength of selection on survival. Mutations increasing mortality in some age classes can even be favoured by selection, but only when fecundity deteriorates rapidly with age. Population structure arising from limited dispersal however selects for a broader distribution of reproduction over the lifetime, potentially slowing down reproductive senescence. The antagonistic effects of limited dispersal on age schedules of fecundity and mortality cast doubts on the generality of conditions allowing the evolution of 'suicide genes' that increase mortality rates without other direct pleiotropic effects. More generally, our model illustrates how limited dispersal and social interactions can indirectly produce patterns of antagonistic pleiotropy affecting vital rates at different ages.},

Little is known about gamete dispersal in fungi, especially in lichen-forming ascomycetes. Here, we estimate the dispersal functions of clonal propagules, gametes and ascospores of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria. We use hierarchical Bayesian parentage analysis, which integrates genetic and ecological information from multiannual colonization and dispersal source data collected in a large, old-growth forest landscape. The effective dispersal range of gametes is several hundred metres to kilometres from potential paternal individuals. By contrast, clonal propagules disperse only tens of metres, and ascospores disperse over several thousand metres. Our study reveals the dispersal distances of individual reproductive units; clonal propagules, gametes and ascospores, which is of great importance for a thorough understanding of the spatial dynamics of ascomycetes. Sexual reproduction occurs between distant individuals. However, whereas gametes and ascospores disperse over long distances, the overall rate of colonization of trees is low. Hence, establishment is the limiting factor for the colonization of new host trees by the lichen in old-growth landscapes.},

  abstract = {Earlier modeling has suggested that long distance gene flow is of importance in increasing the adaptability of tree populations in a changing climate. In times of warming temperatures, early flowering phenotypes may be favored, because early flowering may be connected to early onset of growth. Long term direct measurements of flowering, pollen cloud and intrapopulation fecundity variations are needed to test this hypothesis. Having one of the furthest transported types of pollen grains, birch may have good potential for long distance gene flow. Our daily observations over eight years, of 30 silver birches (Betula pendula Roth), showed that the onset and duration of flowering phenology was determined by the accumulation of spring temperature sums, but the window for potential long distance gene flow was narrow. The interannual phenology variations were large, the order of timing of female and male catkins in various trees of this monoecious species tended to differ, and the timing of generative and vegetative spring phenologies were not correlated at tree level. Early flowering trees tended to have a higher variation in germinability than later flowering trees. No other connection between timing of phenology of flowering and seed quantity or quality was found. Although stochastic climatic conditions produce interannually variable phenological windows, probability for long distance gene flow from areas differing in timing of spring temperature accumulations may be low in silver birch. Intertree variations in fecundity were high, and the majority of seeds and pollen were produced by only a few trees. Moreover, the amount of seeds produced was positively related to seed germinability, thus large phenotypic fecundity variations may decrease interannual genetic variations in seed sets.},

  abstract = {Silver (Betula pendula) and pubescent birch (B. pubescens) are the two main broad-leaved tree species in boreal forests and Subarctic areas, with great significance for both northern societies and ecosystems. Silver birch has more economical importance as it grows taller, but pubescent birch reaches much further North. The adaptability and genetic diversity of Subarctic birch populations are assumed to derive from inter- and intraspecific hybridization. Southern pollen clouds could in turn increase the adaptability of northern populations to warming climate. In the boreal forest zone of warmer climate, incompatibility reactions may prevent interspecific hybridization and much depends on the synchrony of flowering. Direct in situ observations are, however, mostly lacking and earlier results concerning the spatial and temporal match of flowering phenology between the species are contradictory. Conclusions based on pollen catches may also be biased as the pollen of silver and pubescent birch are notoriously difficult to sort out and the geographical origin of pollen is virtually impossible to determine. Here we employ direct flowering observations and reanalyze old pollen and seed production data, collected along a South-North gradient in Finland, to shed more light on these issues. Our results suggest that interspecific hybridization is an unlikely mechanism of adaptation in silver and pubescent birch as there is no significant overlap in flowering either near Subarctic or in more southern boreal areas (covering latitudes 60\textendash{} 68\textdegree{} N). Long-distance southern gene flow also unlikely has importance in the adaptation of northern populations to a warming climate as heat sum requirements for flowering in northern and southern populations are equal and northern birches are therefore not receptive at the time of southern flowering. Long-term data of pollen and seed production in turn suggest that pubescent birch is more effective in seed production through the whole South-North gradient, but increasingly so towards the North. However, it appears that this difference is not due to silver birch flowering and regeneration being more sensitive to interannual variation as earlier suggested. Although there are more factors than reproduction alone that can affect species distributions, these two findings indicate that climate warming may not significantly alter the relative abundances of silver and pubescent birch in Subarctic Fennoscandia.},

To that aim, I first provide results for values of F-statistics in one-dimensional models and coalescence times in two-dimensional models, and make more precise earlier results for F-statistics in two-dimensional models and coalescence times in one-dimensional models. Based on these results, I propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of F(ST)/(1 - F(ST)) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. This regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance. In two cases where comparison to direct estimates is possible, the method proposed here is more satisfactory than previous indirect methods. \textbackslash{}n},

  abstract = {Anisogamy is known to generate an important cost for sexual reproduction (the famous ``twofold cost of sex''). However, male\textendash{} female differences may have other consequences on the evolution of sex, due to the fact that selective pressures may differ among the sexes. On the one hand, intralocus sexual conflict should favor asexual females, which can fix female-beneficial, male-detrimental alleles. On the other hand, it has been suggested repeatedly that sexual selection among males may help to purge the mutation load, providing an advantage to sexual females. However, no analytical model has computed the strength of selection acting on a modifier gene affecting the frequency of sexual reproduction when selection differs between the sexes. In this article, we analyze a two-locus model using two approaches: a quasi-linkage-equilibrium (QLE) analysis and a local stability analysis, whose predictions are verified using a multilocus simulation.We find that costly sex can bemaintainedwhen selection is stronger in males than in females, but acts in the same direction in both. Complete asexuality, however, evolves under any other form of selection. Finally, we discuss how experimental measurements of fitness variances and covariances between sexes could be used to determine the overall direction and strength on selection for sex arising from differences in selection between males and females.},

  abstract = {Landscape connectivity, the extent to which a landscape facilitates the movements of organisms and their genes, faces critical threats from both fragmentation and habitat loss. Many conservation efforts focus on protecting and enhancing connectivity to offset the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity conservation, and to increase the resilience of reserve networks to potential threats associated with climate change. Loss of connectivity can reduce the size and quality of available habitat, impede and disrupt movement (including dispersal) to new habitats, and affect seasonal migration patterns. These changes can lead, in turn, to detrimental effects for populations and species, including decreased carrying capacity, population declines, loss of genetic variation, and ultimately species extinction. Measuring and mapping connectivity is facilitated by a growing number of quantitative approaches that can integrate large amounts of information about organisms' life histories, habitat quality, and other features essential to evaluating connectivity for a given population or species. However, identifying effective approaches for maintaining and restoring connectivity poses several challenges, and our understanding of how connectivity should be designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change is, as yet, in its infancy. Scientists and managers must confront and overcome several challenges inherent in evaluating and planning for connectivity, including: \textbullet{}characterizing the biology of focal species; \textbullet{}understanding the strengths and the limitations of the models used to evaluate connectivity; \textbullet{}considering spatial and temporal extent in connectivity planning; \textbullet{}using caution in extrapolating results outside of observed conditions; \textbullet{}considering non-linear relationships that can complicate assumed or expected ecological responses; \textbullet{}accounting and planning for anthropogenic change in the landscape; \textbullet{}using well-defined goals and objectives to drive the selection of methods used for evaluating and planning for connectivity; \textbullet{}and communicating to the general public in clear and meaningful language the importance of connectivity to improve awareness and strengthen policies for ensuring conservation. Several aspects of connectivity science deserve additional attention in order to improve the effectiveness of design and implementation. Research on species persistence, behavioral ecology, and community structure is needed to reduce the uncertainty associated with connectivity models. Evaluating and testing connectivity responses to climate change will be critical to achieving conservation goals in the face of the rapid changes that will confront many communities and ecosystems. All of these potential areas of advancement will fall short of conservation goals if we do not effectively incorporate human activities into connectivity planning. While this Issue identifies substantial uncertainties in mapping connectivity and evaluating resilience to climate change, it is also clear that integrating human and natural landscape conservation planning to enhance habitat connectivity is essential for biodiversity conservation. \textcopyright{} The Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract = {We examined the hypothesis that tree-ring analyses of juvenile growth traits could be used to predict herbivory during mature years. At Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, USA, some pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) are highly susceptible to the stemboring moth, Dioryctria albovittella, and suffer chronic attack, while other adjacent trees are resistant and have remained relatively moth-free for years. Five major patterns emerged: (1) Susceptible trees suffer from 11 times more shoots killed per tree and produce \dbend{}0.05 times as many cones as resistant trees. (2) This herbivore is largely restricted to reproductively mature trees that, at this site, are generally older than 46 yr. (3) Analysis of treering data from resistant and susceptible trees shows that trees that eventually became susceptible grew more vigorously during their attack-free juvenile years than resistant trees (growth rings were 29\% wider). However, when they matured and suffered chronic herbivory, susceptible trees produced growth rings 13\% smaller than resistant trees. (4) Although previous studies showed that resistance was associated with higher oleoresin flow, we did not observe this pattern. Instead, we found that resistance was best correlated with slower juvenile growth rates. Current-year shoots of susceptible mature trees averaged 50\% larger than those on resistant mature trees. (5) Tree-ring analyses supported the hypothesis of a trade-off between growth and resistance. This study shows that dendrochronology can be used as a tool to predict future herbivory and demonstrates that the fastest growing juvenile trees suffer the poorest performance decades later when they become moth-susceptible mature trees. Furthermore, it illustrates that traits associated with plant development can greatly affect herbivore distributions, and that herbivore selection pressures on juvenile trees can be very different than on mature trees.},

We studied 20-, 10-, and 1-year-old rice swiddens, single tree extraction sites for dugouts, and homegardens in comparison with multi-use mature forests to examine whether Wounaan forest use histories could be distinguished by vegetation patterns and Landsat satellite imagery. We found that forest use histories were discriminated by vegetation structure and floristics, but these uses were largely obscured in satellite images. We discuss how conservation planning is impacted by these different methods, particularly how the perceived objectivity of satellite imagery may be used to dichotomize culture and nature. We conclude by encouraging the critical use of satellite imagery in conservation by using mixed methods at multiple temporal and spatial scales.},

  abstract = {We proposed the hydraulic limitation hypothesis (HLH) as a mechanism to explain universal patterns in tree height, and tree and stand biomass growth: height growth slows down as trees grow taller, maximum height is lower for trees of the same species on resource-poor sites and annual wood production declines after canopy closure for even-aged forests. Our review of 51 studies that measured one or more of the components necessary for testing the hypothesis showed that taller trees differ physiologically from shorter, younger trees. Stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)), photosynthesis (A) and leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (K L) are often, but not always, lower in taller trees. Additionally, leaf mass per area is often greater in taller trees, and leaf area:sapwood area ratio changes with tree height. We conclude that hydraulic limitation of gas exchange with increasing tree size is common, but not universal. Where hydraulic limitations to A do occur, no evidence supports the original expectation that hydraulic limitation of carbon assimilation is sufficient to explain observed declines in wood production. Any limit to height or height growth does not appear to be related to the so-called age-related decline in wood production of forests after canopy closure. Future work on this problem should explicitly link leaf or canopy gas exchange with tree and stand growth, and consider a more fundamental assumption: whether tree biomass growth is limited by carbon availability.},

The impact of local wind, its speed and direction are less commonly investigated in aerobiological surveys mainly due to difficulties related to the employment of specific analytical tools and interpretation of their outputs. Identification of inoculum sources of economically important plant pathogens, as well as highly allergenic bioaerosols like Cladosporium species, has not been yet explored with remote sensing data and atmospheric models such as Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT). We, therefore, performed an analysis of 24 h intra-diurnal cycle of Cladosporium spp. spores from an urban site in connection with both the local wind direction and overall air mass direction computed by HYSPLIT. The observational method was a volumetric air sampler of the Hirst design with 1 h time resolution and corresponding optical detection of fungal spores with light microscopy. The atmospheric modelling was done using the on-line data set from GDAS with 1\textdegree{} resolution and circular statistical methods. Our results showed stronger, statistically significant correlation (. p {$\leq$} 0.05) between high Cladosporium spp. spore concentration and air mass direction compared to the local wind direction. This suggested that a large fraction of the investigated fungal spores had a regional origin and must be located more than a few kilometers away from the sampling point.},

The knowledge science seeks, unlike the information markets gather, tends to be centralized, collaborative, collective, and consensus-based; science pursues concepts and principles that are timeless and general rather than ephemeral and site-specific. The paper contrasts the dispersed and decentralized information organized by markets with the collective and centralized knowledge characteristic of science.

This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger ( p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover ( p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas. Our results indicate that, whereas placement of sacred areas and preservation of vegetation cover affects useful plants, biodiversity and endemism, within habitats sacred sites preserve old growth trees and forest structure.

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions has led to adaptive genetic differentiation and the development of home-site fitness advantage (local adaptation) among populations of many widespread plant species such as forest trees. Although its overall patterns have been well characterised, earlier studies on adaptation have predominantly used long-term averages of environmental variables to describe local climates. Subsequently, only little is currently known about more complex patterns of variation in potential selective forces and how they affect adaptive processes. Furthermore, we also lack a good understanding of why adaptive traits often vary within populations despite clear evidence of local selection. Because the capacity of a population to respond to changes in its home environment depends on the amount of genetic variation that it contains, an understanding of these patterns is fundamental to predicting how extant populations will cope with climate change. In this paper, I call attention to these two issues and discuss adaptation in heterogeneous environments using studies mainly on Finnish populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) as an example. In this geographic area, population means in growth cessation are closely related to the latitude at the population's home site, indicating adaptation to local environments. Yet the trait varies considerably also within populations, with the highest levels of phenotypic variation found in the central part of the latitudinal gradient. Increased variation further north may have a significant genetic component. In stable local environments this would indicate that populations with less variation are more optimally adapted to their home site environments. On the other hand, climate data show that growing season temperature conditions within Finland become temporally more variable towards the north which might contribute to different levels of trait variation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the weaknesses of focusing only on long-term averages of environmental variables or trait means when examining adaptation in natural populations. Moreover, better integrated analyses of both genetic and environmental variation might help in disentangling the mechanisms that maintain adaptive genetic diversity and adaptive capacity in natural populations of perennial species under changing environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Climate change can markedly impact biology, population ecology, and spatial patterns of eruptive insects due to the direct influence of temperature on insect development and population success. The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a landscape-altering insect that infests forests of North America. Abundant availability of host trees due to altered disturbance regimes has facilitated an unprecedented, landscape-wide outbreak of this pest in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, during the past decade. A previous outbreak in the 1980s, in central British Columbia, collapsed due to host depletion and extreme cold weather events. Despite the importance of such extreme weather events and other temperature-related signals in modulating an outbreak, few landscape-level models have studied the associations of extreme cold events with outbreak occurrences. We studied the individual associations of several biologically-relevant cold temperature variables, and other temperature/degree-day terms, with outbreak occurrences in a spatial-temporal logistic regression model using data from the current outbreak. Timing, frequency, and duration of cold snaps had a severe negative association with occurrence of an outbreak in a given area. Large drops in temperature ({$>$}10\textdegree{}C) or extreme winter minimum temperatures reduced the outbreak probability. We then used the model to apply eight different climate change scenarios to the peak year of the current outbreak. Our scenarios involved combinations of increasing annual temperature and different variances about this trend. Our goal was to examine how spatial outbreak pattern would have changed in the face of changing thermal regime if the underlying outbreak behaviour remained consistent. We demonstrate that increases in mean temperature by 1\textdegree{}C to 4\textdegree{}C profoundly increased the risk of outbreaks with effects first being manifested at higher elevations and then at increasing latitudes. However, increasing the variance associated with a mean temperature increase did not change the overall trend in outbreak potential.},

  abstract = {A species is expected to occur where the prevailing biotic and abiotic conditions fall within its fundamental niche. Geographic range limits should, therefore, occur when the survival and fitness of individuals along ecological gradients is reduced to the point at which populations are no longer self-sustaining. Abrupt limits to a species' distribution are expected to reflect abrupt changes in the ecological conditions that cause sharp declines in fitness across the limit. We investigated the correlation between geographic variation in environment and fitness across the abrupt northern range limit of a coastal dune plant, Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia (Onagraceae). In each of 64 plots distributed across five sites along a 200-km transect spanning the species' northern range limit (four within the range plus one beyond the limit), we measured plant community composition as a proxy for variation in biotic and abiotic environmental factors and lifetime fitness of genetically standardized experimental populations of C. cheiranthifolia. There was substantial variation in plant community composition among plots and sites across the range limit, and fitness of experimental plants covaried strongly with the first principal component of plant community composition. However, we did not detect an abrupt shift in plant community or the expected decline in fitness across the range limit. In fact, fitness and recruitment increased toward the limit and were relatively high beyond the limit. This suggests that habitat beyond the range did not occur outside of the species' fundamental niche. These results challenge niche-based explanations for range limits and suggest that hypotheses involving the finer-scale distribution of habitat patches or constraints on dispersal warrant more serious consideration.},

We investigated the contribution of plasticity and local adaptation to the performance of a common aquatic plant (Potamogeton pectinatus) in contrasting climates, using reciprocal transplants at three experimental sites across a latitudinal cline in Europe. Plants from 54 genets, originally collected from 14 populations situated within four climatic regions (subarctic, cold temperate, mild temperate, and mediterranean) were grown in three different localities within three of these regions (cold temperate, Norway; mild temperate, The Netherlands; mediterranean, Spain). Tuber production was highest for the mild-temperate genets, irrespective of locality where the genets were grown. Selection coefficients indicated that populations at the European center of the species distribution perform better than all other populations, at all sites. However, marginal populations showed changes in life-history traits, such as compressed life cycles in the north and true perenniality in the south, that may allow them to perform better locally, at the limits of their distribution range. Our results thus suggest that local adaptation may overlap spatially with center-periphery gradients in performance caused by genetic factors (such as genetic drift and inbreeding in range-marginal populations).},

Rainfall declined rapidly after the late 1970s following trends for the entire Mediterranean and was associated with reduced tree-ring width in Pinus brutia. The most recent decline led to the lowest annual radial stem increment after the last 100 years (as far as records reach). As moisture availability decreased best correlations of tree growth with rainfall were obtained for progressively longer integration periods (1-2 years in moister periods, 5-6 years during the severe dryness of 20th century's last decades), suggesting increasing dependency in deep soil water. Such long-term integration periods of tree-growth responses to precipitation have not been reported before. They may reflect a tree-rooting pattern adapted to cope with even several successive dry years. In late summer 2000, moisture reserves became exhausted, however, and a substantial fraction of low altitude pines died, including some 80-year-old trees, which underlines the exceptional extent this trend had reached. Our findings provide empirical support for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections derived from global circulation models that the Mediterranean, its eastern basin in particular, should become drier as temperature rises, as was the case in the recent past. \textcopyright{} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Preface Landscape ecology continues to grow as an exciting, dynamic ecological discipline. With its broadscale emphasis and multidisciplinary approach, landscape ecology lends itself both to basic research and to applications in land management, land-use planning, wildlife management, ecosystem management, and conservation biology. Landscape ecology makes a unique contribution to the scientific community in its attention to ecological dynamics across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and as a result it has become increasingly important for students in the natural sciences to gain a basic understanding of the subject. Colleges and universities across the United States are incorporating courses in landscape ecology into their curricula. However, nearly every book on landscape ecology is a book to be read, lacking a hands-on approach. This text is intended to fill that void by providing a comprehensive collection of landscape ecology laboratory exercises. These teaching exercises stress the fundamental concepts of landscape ecology, rather than highly specialized, technical methods. While students will gain experience using a variety of tools commonly used in landscape ecology, we stress the conceptual understanding necessary to use these techniques appropriately. This book attempts to convey the myriad approaches used by landscape ecologists (as well as a multitude of approaches to teaching) and include group discussion, thought problems, fieldwork, data analysis, spatial data collection, exposure to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), simulation modeling, analysis of landscape metrics, spatial statistics, and written exercises. This book is divided into seven sections, which complement the companion textbook, Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice: Pattern and Process, by M. G. Turner, R. H. Gardner, and R. V. O{\^a}texttrademarkNeill. However, this textbook is also a useful stand-alone volume that can be used for teaching and learning.

Here we investigated nine chronologies from Switzerland covering the last two centuries, including three deciduous species (Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, and Quercus petraea) and three conifer species (Abies alba, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris) from sites neither strongly limited by temperature nor precipitation. All of the chronologies except Fraxinus were significantly correlated to at least one other chronology. Correlations between different species of the same site were of similar strength to correlations between the sites. We observed a strong common high-frequency (interannual) signal for the delta C-13 Ohronologies, whereas the low-frequency (decadal-scale) signal was more similar among the delta O-18 chronologies. For both carbon and oxygen isotopes, we found significant positive relationships with annual and growing season temperatures and negative relationships with precipitation, again of similar magnitude for all species except for Fraxinus, which contained only minor climatic information. Averaging of all chronologies resulted in an increase in the climatic signal of the mean chronology. The combined delta O-18 record reflected decadal-scale temperature variations remarkably well (r = 0.72). However, the relationship between climate and carbon isotopes declined over the last 3 decades of the 20th century, probably related to the steep increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, resulting in strongly diverging delta C-13 trends of the different chronologies. Our study indicates that combining chronologies from different species enhances the potential of isotope studies for extending climate reconstructions into areas of temperate climate.},

  abstract = {Populations are locally adapted when populations have the highest relative fitness at their home sites, and lower fitness in other parts of the range. Results from the extensive experimental plantations of populations of forest trees from different parts of the range show that populations can survive and grow in broad areas outside the home site. However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection. Genetic differentiation and strong natural selection occur over a range of tens or hundreds of kilometers, but reliable measurements of gene flow are available only for much shorter distances. Current models of spatially varying selection could be made more realistic by the incorporation of st...},

Genomic tools are now allowing genome-wide studies, and recent theoretical advances can help to design research strategies that combine genomics and field experiments to examine the genetics of local adaptation.

In contrast, studies of fitness variation in natural conditions are spread over a large number of species with poorly understood genomes. Two reports in this issue, by Fournier-Level et al. on page 86 (1) and Hancock et al. on page 83 (2), report a major advance toward finding the genomic sites related to climatic adaptation in A. thaliana by combining genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and fitness estimates.

  abstract = {Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration decreases stomatal conductance in many species, but the savings of water from reduced transpiration may permit the forest to retain greater leaf area index (L). Therefore, the net effect on water use in forest ecosystems under a higher CO2 atmosphere is difficult to predict. The free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility (n=3) in a 14-m tall (in 1996) Pinus taeda L. stand was designed to reduce uncertainties in predicting such responses. Continuous measurements of precipitation, throughfall precipitation, sap flux, and soil moisture were made over 3.5 years under ambient (CO2a) and elevated (CO2e) ambient + 200 {$\mu$}mol mol-1). Annual stand transpiration under ambient CO2 conditions accounted for 84-96\% of latent heat flux measured with the eddy-covariance technique above the canopy. Under CO2e, P. taeda transpired less per unit of leaf area only when soil drought was severe. Liquidambar styraciflua, the other major species in the forest, used progressively less water, settling at 25\% reduction in sap flux density after 3.5 years under CO2e. Because P. taeda dominated the stand, and severe drought periods were of relatively short duration, the direct impact of CO2e on water savings in the stand was undetectable. Moreover, the forest used progressively more water under CO2e, probably because soil moisture availability progressively increased, probably owing to a reduction in soil evaporation caused by more litter buildup in the CO2e plots. The results suggest that, in this forest, the effect of CO2e on transpiration was greater indirectly through enhanced litter production than directly through reduced stomatal conductance. In forests composed of species more similar to L. styraciflua, water savings from stomatal closure may dominate the response to CO2e.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is now in full swing, our global average temperature already having increased by 1\textdegree{}C from preindustrial levels. Many studies have documented individual impacts of the changing climate that are particular to species or regions, but individual impacts are accumulating and being amplified more broadly. Scheffers et al. review the set of impacts that have been observed across genes, species, and ecosystems to reveal a world already undergoing substantial change. Understanding the causes, consequences, and potential mitigation of these changes will be essential as we move forward into a warming world.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aaf7671 BACKGROUNDClimate change impacts have now been documented across every ecosystem on Earth, despite an average warming of only \textasciitilde{}1\textdegree{}C so far. Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82\% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem.ADVANCESSpecies are undergoing evolutionary adaptation to temperature extremes, and climate change has substantial impacts on species physiology that include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex ratios in species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and increased metabolic costs of living in a warmer world. These physiological adjustments have observable impacts on morphology, with many species in both aquatic and terrestrial systems shrinking in body size because large surface-to-volume ratios are generally favored under warmer conditions. Other morphological changes include reductions in melanism to improve thermoregulation, and altered wing and bill length in birds.Broader-scale responses to climate change include changes in the phenology, abundance, and distribution of species. Temperate plants are budding and flowering earlier in spring and later in autumn. Comparable adjustments have been observed in marine and freshwater fish spawning events and in the timing of seasonal migrations of animals worldwide. Changes in the abundance and age structure of populations have also been observed, with widespread evidence of range expansion in warm-adapted species and range contraction in cold-adapted species. As a by-product of species redistributions, novel community interactions have emerged. Tropical and boreal species are increasingly incorporated into temperate and polar communities, respectively, and when possible, lowland species are increasingly assimilating into mountain communities. Multiplicative impacts from gene to community levels scale up to produce ecological regime shifts, in which one ecosystem state shifts to an alternative state.OUTLOOKThe many observed impacts of climate change at different levels of biological organization point toward an increasingly unpredictable future for humans. Reduced genetic diversity in crops, inconsistent crop yields, decreased productivity in fisheries from reduced body size, and decreased fruit yields from fewer winter chill events threaten food security. Changes in the distribution of disease vectors alongside the emergence of novel pathogens and pests are a direct threat to human health as well as to crops, timber, and livestock resources. Humanity depends on intact, functioning ecosystems for a range of goods and services. Enhanced understanding of the observed impacts of climate change on core ecological processes is an essential first step to adapting to them and mitigating their influence on biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.Climate change impacts on ecological processes in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems.Impacts can be measured on multiple processes at different levels of biological organization within ecosystems. In total, 82\% of 94 ecological processes show evidence of being affected by climate change. Within levels of organization, the percentage of processes impacted varies from 60\% for genetics to 100\% for species distribution.Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that higher respiratory losses caused by higher temperatures in the lowlands, compared to montane sites, prevent growth of the montane hemicryptophyte Petasites albus (Asteraceae). In addition, we tested whether increased levels of herbivory enhanced carbon losses at lower elevations. Rhizomes of Petasites albus were transplanted to a montane and a lowland site. In the subsequent three growing seasons the plants were artificially defoliated to simulate mollusc herbivory. Whereas there were no altitudinal differences in the leaf number per plant, the leaf area was higher at the montane site. At the montane site, the leaf number and leaf area decreased with increasing damage, and the rhizome dry weight in the third year was much higher in the undamaged plants. In contrast, fructan concentrations in the rhizomes that were harvested at the end and at the beginning of the growing seasons were generally higher at the lowland site. No clear defoliation effects were observed on most harvest dates. The results indicate that the lower altitudinal limit of Petasites albus cannot be explained by the negative effects of higher temperatures or more leaf damage by herbivores in the lowlands, either alone or in combination. An explanation will require consideration of other site factors such as competition and possibly interactions with herbivory and carbohydrate storage.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a key determinant of a population's evolutionary potential. It facilitates the propagation of beneficial alleles throughout the distributional range of spatially outspread populations and increases the speed of adaptation. However, when habitat is heterogeneous and individuals are locally adapted, dispersal may, at the same time, reduce fitness through increasing maladaptation. Here, we use a spatially explicit, allelic simulation model to quantify how these equivocal effects of dispersal affect a population's evolutionary response to changing climate. Individuals carry a diploid set of chromosomes, with alleles coding for adaptation to non-climatic environmental conditions and climatic conditions, respectively. Our model results demonstrate that the interplay between gene flow and habitat heterogeneity may decrease effective dispersal and population size to such an extent that substantially reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Importantly, even when evolutionary rescue saves a population from extinction, its spatial range following climate change may be strongly narrowed, that is, the rescue is only partial. These findings emphasize that neglecting the impact of non-climatic, local adaptation might lead to a considerable overestimation of a population's evolvability under rapid environmental change.},

Our two management scenarios were conventional harvest and a pine-reduction strategy modeled on a component of Alberta's Mountain Pine Beetle Management Strategy. The pine strategy seeks to reduce the number of susceptible pine stands by 75\% over the next 20 years through targeted harvesting by the forest industry. Our simulations showed that the pine strategy could not be effectively implemented, even if the onset of the beetle outbreak was delayed for 20 years. Even though we increased mill capacity by 20\% and directed all harvesting to high volume pine stands during the pine strategy's surge cut, the amount of highly susceptible pine was reduced by only 43\%. Additional pine volume remained within mixed stands that were not targeted by the pine strategy. When the outbreak occurred in each scenario, sufficient pine remained on the landscape for the beetle to cause the timber supply to collapse.

Increasing the frequency of resistance to WPBR is the foundation for options to sustain five-needle pine species in the presence of the pathogen. Depending on the condition of the ecosystems, increasing resistance can be achieved via outplanting resistant seedling stock and/or stimulating natural regeneration (Schoettle and Sniezko 2007). As the objective of management intervention in the high elevation ecosystems is often to promote multiple generations of sustainability, greater understanding of the regeneration cycle and the potential for increasing the frequency of resistance are needed. This is especially critical for the WPBR pathosystem as WPBR kills trees of all ages and therefore impacts multiple stages of the regeneration cycle of five-needle pines.  http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/38211},

However, experiments growing plants under elevated pCO2in both chamber and field settings, as well as meta-analyses of ecological and agricultural data, have yielded a wide range of estimates for the effect of pCO2on the net isotopic discrimination ({$\Delta\delta$}13Cp) between plant tissue ({$\delta$}13Cp) and atmospheric CO2({$\delta$}13CCO2). Because plant stomata respond sensitively to plant water status and simultaneously alter the concentration of pCO2inside the plant (ci) relative to outside the plant (ca), any experiment that lacks environmental control over water availability across treatments could result in additional isotopic variation sufficient to mask or cancel the direct influence of pCO2on {$\Delta\delta$}13Cp. We present new data from plant growth chambers featuring enhanced dynamic stabilization of moisture availability and relative humidity, in addition to providing constant light, nutrient, {$\delta$}13CCO2, and pCO2level for up to four weeks of plant growth. Within these chambers, we grew a total of 191 C3plants (128 Raphanus sativus plants and 63 Arabidopsis thaliana) across fifteen levels of pCO2ranging from 370 to 4200ppm. Three types of plant tissue were harvested and analyzed for carbon isotope value: above-ground tissues, below-ground tissues, and leaf-extracted nC31-alkanes. We observed strong hyperbolic correlations (R{$\geq$}0.94) between the pCO2level and {$\Delta\delta$}13Cpfor each type of plant tissue analyzed; furthermore the linear relationships previously suggested by experiments across small (10-350ppm) changes in pCO2(e.g., 300-310ppm or 350-700ppm) closely agree with the amount of fractionation per ppm increase in pCO2calculated from our hyperbolic relationship. In this way, our work is consistent with, and provides a unifying relationship for, previous work on carbon isotopes in C3plants at elevated pCO2. The values for {$\Delta\delta$}13Cpwe determined in our ambient pCO2chambers are consistent with the {$\Delta\delta$}13Cpvalues measured in large modern datasets of plants growing within the Earth's wettest environments, suggesting that it may be possible to reconstruct changes in paleo-pCO2level from plants that grew in consistently wet environments, if {$\delta$}13CCO2value and initial pCO2level can be independently quantified. Several implications arise for the reconstruction of water availability and water-use efficiency in both ancient and recent plant {$\Delta\delta$}13Cpvalues across periods of changing pCO2level. For example, the change in {$\Delta\delta$}13Cpimplied by our relationship for the rise in pCO2concentration observed since 1980 is of the same magnitude (= {$\sim$}0.7\textperthousand{}) as the isotopic correction for changes in {$\delta$}13CCO2required by the input of13C-depleted carbon to the atmosphere. For these reasons, only the portion of the terrestrial isotopic excursion that persists after accounting for changes in pCO2concentration should be used for the interpretation of a change in paleo-environmental conditions. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Pollen-mediated gene flow and the male reproductive success of wind-pollinated trees depend on the initial viability of the pollen and the changes that occur in its viability during transport in the atmosphere. The viability of Quercus robur pollen was determined before and during exposure to sunlight by in vitro germination and the fluorescein diacetate reaction (FCR) in 2002 and 2003, respectively. These experiments allowed us to calculate initial pollen viability and pollen sensitivity to sunlight. The germination test revealed a lower initial pollen viability (25-65\%) than the FCR (53- 92\%). Following 9.5 h of irradiation the viability was reduced to 75-100\% as determined by the in vitro germination test or to 40-70\% as determined by the FCR. The actual values of initial pollen viability and pollen sensitivity to sunlight were used to define a range of values for modelling pollen dispersal using the mesoscale meteorological model METRAS. The deposition patterns of viable pollen varied by as much as a factor of 14 by changing the viability parameters in the range of the observed values. This suggests significant differences in male reproductive success. Variations in initial pollen viability have stronger effects on the gene-flow pattern than do variations in pollen sensitivity to sunlight. In particular, pollen distribution throughout the local environment is shaped by the initial pollen viability, while pollen sensitivity to sunlight mainly influences long-distance pollen dispersal.},

Pollination phenology was studied at 8 sites along this transect and allozyme frequencies were determined in two populations at each end of the transect to evaluate the level of interpopulation gene flow. Pollen release and megastrobilus receptivity were synchronous within populations, lasting about 15 days. Pollination phenology was strongly affected by site alt. Most sites that differed in alt. by more than 400 m did not have overlapping pollination periods, and thus interpopulation gene flow was restricted despite strong westerly winds. Gene frequencies were significantly different between upper and lower treeline populations at eight of the ten loci surveyed. Nevertheless, gene flow was estimated to be 11.1 migrants per generation between these two populations. Stepping-stone pollen transfer between intermediate populations and a high rate of gene flow via seeds may be responsible. Thus, despite the altitudinal restriction on long-distance gene flow via pollen, limber pine appears to maintain a high rate of interpopulation gene flow.},

  abstract = {The impact of global warming on phenology has been widely studied, and almost consistently advancing spring events have been reported. Especially in alpine regions, an extraordinary rapid warming has been observed in the last decades. However, little is known about phenological phases over the whole vegetation period at high elevations. We observed 12 phenological phases of seven tree species and measured air temperature at 42 sites along four transects of about 1000 m elevational range in the years 2010 and 2011 near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Site- and species-specific onset dates for the phenological phases were determined and related to elevation, temperature lapse rates and site-specific temperature sums. Increasing temperatures induced advanced spring and delayed autumn phases, in which both yielded similar magnitudes. Delayed leaf senescence could therefore have been underestimated until now in extending the vegetation period. Not only the vegetation period, but also phenological periods extended with increasing temperature. Moreover, sensitivity to elevation and temperature strongly depends on the specific phenological phase. Differences between species and groups of species (deciduous, evergreen, high elevation) were found in onset dates, phenological response rates and also in the effect of chilling and forcing temperatures. Increased chilling days highly reduced forcing temperature requirements for deciduous trees, but less for evergreen trees. The problem of shifted species associations and phenological mismatches due to species-specific responses to increasing temperature is a recent topic in ecological research. Therefore, we consider our findings from this novel, dense observation network in an alpine area of particular importance to deepen knowledge on phenological responses to climate change.},

First, F(1) hybrids produced as many viable seed as P. angustifolia (but less than P. fremontii), and backcross genotypes produced as many viable seeds as both parent taxa. Second, hybrids produced nearly two times as many ramets from root sprouts as P. angustifolia and four times as many ramets as P. fremontii. Third, the high mortality of germinated seedlings of all tree types (i.e., {$>$}90\%) and very low mortality of asexually derived ramets provide hybrids with equal sexual reproduction and enhanced asexual reproduction, especially since backcross hybrids exhibit transgressive segregation in ramet production. Our findings suggest that the introgression of P. fremontii seed traits into the hybrid genome is responsible for their equivalent performance (at least to one parent) in sexual reproduction, while the contributions of asexual traits from P. angustifola results in hybrids having equal or greater fitness.},

Modelling tools have been developed for this purpose but are often discrete-space, discrete-time spatial-mechanistic models that adopt a computer simulation approach and resist mathematical analysis. We constructed a simple demographic matrix model to explore the local population dynamics of an invasive species with a complex life history and whose invasive success depends on resource availability, which occurs stochastically. As a case study we focused on the American black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), a gap-dependent tree able both to constitute a long-living seedling bank under unfavourable light conditions and to resprout vigorously once cut-down, which is invading European temperate forests. The model used was a stage-classified matrix population model (i.e., Lefkovitch matrix), integrating environmental stochasticity. Stochastic matrix projection analysis was combined with elasticity analysis and stochastic simulations to search for the species' 'Achille heel'. As expected, the population growth rate (i.e., Lyapunov exponent), which measures the risk of P. serotina invasion at the stand scale, increased with light frequency. There was a critical value above which the population of P. serotina explodes and below which it locally goes extinct. The resprouting capacity usually speed up the invasion but appeared to play a minor role. The mean duration of stand invasion was measured and important life stage transitions that mostly contribute to the local stochastic growth rate were identified. Some relevant management implications are discussed and the interest of such models for the understanding of demographic characteristics of invasive species is stressed. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Clay content and soil water-holding capacity increased consistently with substrate age, but both soil organic C and N increased only up to the 750,000 year site and then declined at the oldest (3,000,000 year) site. Measures of soil C and N flux displayed a similar pattern to total C and N pools. Pools and fluxes of C and N among the three canopy types became more homogeneous with substrate age up to the 750,000 year site, but disparity between tree and intercanopy microsites widened again at the oldest site. The d15N of both tree leaves and surface soils became progressively more enriched across the substrate age gradient, consistent with a N cycle increasingly dominated by isotope fractionating losses. Our results point to consistencies in patterns of ecosystem development between semiarid and more humid ecosystems and suggest that pedogenic development may be an important factor controlling the spatial distribution of soil resources in semiarid ecosystems. These data should help both unify and broaden current theory of terrestrial ecosystem development.},

  abstract = {Gene flow among populations can enhance local adaptation if it introduces new genetic variants available for selection, but strong gene flow can also stall adaptation by swamping locally beneficial genes. These outcomes can depend on population size, genetic variation, and the environmental context. Gene flow patterns may align with geographic distance (IBD--isolation by distance), whereby immigration rates are inversely proportional to the distance between populations. Alternatively gene flow may follow patterns of isolation by environment (IBE), whereby gene flow rates are higher among similar environments. Finally, gene flow may be highest among dissimilar environments (counter-gradient gene flow), the classic "gene-swamping" scenario. Here we survey relevant studies to determine the prevalence of each pattern across environmental gradients. Of 70 studies, we found evidence of IBD in 20.0\%, IBE in 37.1\%, and both patterns in 37.1\%. In addition, 10.0\% of studies exhibited counter-gradient gene flow. In total, 74.3\% showed significant IBE patterns. This predominant IBE pattern of gene flow may have arisen directly through natural selection or reflect other adaptive and nonadaptive processes leading to nonrandom gene flow. It also precludes gene swamping as a widespread phenomenon. Implications for evolutionary processes and management under rapidly changing environments (e.g., climate change) are discussed.},

To address this question, I used observed relationships between contemporary richness and climate, coupled with climate projections from five GCM, to project these future changes.

Mammal and bird richness are predicted to decrease in much of the southern US and to increase in cool, mountainous areas.

In order to project potential vegetation response to future climate change, this study uses response surfaces to describe the relationship between bioclimatic variables and the distribution of tree and shrub taxa in western North America. The response surfaces illustrate the probability of occurrence of a taxon at particular points in climate space. Climate space was defined using three bioclimatic variables: mean temperature of the coldest month, growing degree days, and a moisture index. Species distributions were simulated under present climate, using observed data (1951-1980, 30-yr mean), and under future climate (2090-2099, 10-yr mean), using scenarios generated by three general circulation models: HADCM2, CGCM1, and CSIRO. The scenarios assume a 1\% per year compound increase in greenhouse gases and changes in SO4 aerosols based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The results indicate that for many tree and shrub taxa potential range changes under future climate conditions could be large. Shifts in the potential ranges of species are simulated to occur not only northward but in all directions, including southward of the existing ranges of certain species. The simulated potential distributions of some species become increasingly fragmented under the future climate scenarios, while the simulated potential distributions of other species expand. The magnitudes of the simulated range changes imply significant impacts to ecosystems and shifts in patterns of species diversity in western North America.},

  abstract = {Much is now known about the consistency of Bayesian updating on infinite-dimensional parameter spaces with independent or Markovian data. Necessary conditions for consistency include the prior putting enough weight on the correct neighborhoods of the data-generating distribution; various sufficient conditions further restrict the prior in ways analogous to capacity control in frequentist nonparametrics. The asymptotics of Bayesian updating with mis-specified models or priors, or non-Markovian data, are far less well explored. Here I establish sufficient conditions for posterior convergence when all hypotheses are wrong, and the data have complex dependencies. The main dynamical assumption is the asymptotic equipartition (Shannon-McMillan-Breiman) property of information theory. This, along with Egorov's Theorem on uniform convergence, lets me build a sieve-like structure for the prior. The main statistical assumption, also a form of capacity control, concerns the compatibility of the prior and the data-generating process, controlling the fluctuations in the log-likelihood when averaged over the sieve-like sets. In addition to posterior convergence, I derive a kind of large deviations principle for the posterior measure, extending in some cases to rates of convergence, and discuss the advantages of predicting using a combination of models known to be wrong. An appendix sketches connections between these results and the replicator dynamics of evolutionary theory.},

To test this hypothesis, plantations of seven agroforestry (AF) systems were raised in a two hectare experimental site at Yeppoon (Central Queensland) in June 2002. The AF systems included three species, viz Pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens; P), Ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus; B) and Flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis; E) that have shallow, medium and deep root system, respectively. The raised AF systems were either monoculture or in various combinations of the species and resulted in seven cropping systems (P, B, E, PB, PE, BE, PBE). The seven agroforestry systems were irrigated at 180 mm/ha/y as determined by the MEDLI (Model for Effluent Disposal using Land Irrigation). Managing the irrigation rate was found crucial for environmental sustainability of land disposal of effluents. Soil moisture monitored over two years revealed that E. grandis plots were driest but at par with Ma Bamboo + E. grandis plots closely followed by Pangola plots and other agroforestry systems. Root densities in the first 30 cm under all agroforestry systems were similar, but in 30-60cm, Pangola systems had the highest root densities. In 60\textendash{}100 cm depth, eucalypt based systems produced greatest density of roots. Hence in short-rotation, agroforestry systems may perform at par with conventionally favoured monoculture tree plantations. The systems may be preferred for their additional commercial crops.},

For example, the influence of climatic "teleconnections" (the relationship between oceanic-atmospheric fluctuations and anomalous weather patterns across broad scales) on forest age structure is relatively unexplored. We sampled semiarid pi{\~n}on-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands in western Colorado, U.S.A., to test the hypothesis that woodland age structures are shaped by climate, including links to oceanic-atmospheric fluctuations, and by past fires and livestock grazing. Low-severity surface fire was lacking, as fire scars were absent, and did not influence woodland densities, but stand-replacing fires served as long-rotation ({$>$}400-600 years), stand-initiating events. Old-growth stands ({$>$}300 years old) were found in 75\% of plots, consistent with a long fire rotation. Juniper and pi{\~n}on age structures suggest contrasting responses during the past several centuries to dry and wet episodes linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Juniper density increased slightly during periods of drought, positive (warm) AMO (after approximately 10-year lag), and negative (cool) PDO. In contrast, pi{\~n}on populations may still be recovering from a long, drought-filled period (AD 1620-1820), with pulses of recovery favored during cool AMO, warm PDO, and above-average moisture periods. Analysis of 20th-century tree establishment and instrumental climate data corroborate the long-term relationships between age structure and climate. After Euro-American settlement (AD 1881), livestock grazing reduced understory grasses and forbs, reducing competition with tree seedlings and facilitating climate-induced increases in pi{\~n}ons. Thus tree populations in these woodlands are in flux, affected by drought and wet periods linked to oceanic-atmospheric variability, Euro-American livestock grazing, and long-rotation, high-severity fires. Reductions in livestock grazing levels may aid ecological restoration efforts. However, given long-term fluctuations in tree density and composition, and expected further drought, thinning or burning to reduce tree populations may be misdirected.},

Because the death penalty is governed by state laws rather than federal laws, it is of special interest to know how public opinion varies by state, and how it has changed over time within each state. We combine dozens of national polls taken over a 50-year span and fit a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to estimate support for the death penalty as a function of the year, the state, state level variables and various individual level demographic variables. Among our findings were that support levels in northeastern and southern states have moved in opposite directions over the past 50 years, support among blacks has decreased relative to non-blacks, but at slightly different rates for men and women, and support among some education groups varies widely by region. Throughout the paper, we highlight the use of a variety of analytical and graphical tools for model understanding, including average predictive comparisons, finite population contrasts for overparameterized models and graphical summaries of posterior distributions of group level variance parameters.},

Rather than taking the common approach of comparing different populations or sites, here we studied gene flow via wind-mediated effective pollen dispersal on the same plant individuals before and after a fire-induced population drop, in a natural stand of Pinus halepensis. The fire killed 96\% of the pine trees in the stand and cleared the vegetation in the area. Thirteen trees survived in two groups separated by similar to 80 m, and seven of these trees had serotinous (closed) prefire cones that did not open despite the fire. We analysed pollen from closed pre and postfire cones using microsatellites. The two groups of surviving trees were highly genetically differentiated, and the pollen they produced also showed strong among-group differentiation and very high kinship both before and after the fire, indicating limited and very local pollen dispersal. The pollen not produced by the survivors also showed significant prefire spatial genetic structure and high kinship, indicating mainly within-population origin and limited gene flow from outside, but became spatially homogeneous with random kinship after the fire. We suggest that postfire gene flow via wind-mediated pollen dispersal increased by two putative mechanisms: (i) a drastic reduction in local pollen production due to population thinning, effectively increasing pollen immigration through reduced dilution effect; (ii) an increase in wind speeds in the vegetation-free postfire landscape. This research shows that dispersal can alleviate negative genetic effects of population size reduction and that disturbances might enhance gene flow, rather than reduce it.},

  abstract = {For two genotypes that have the same mean number of offspring but differ in the variance in offspring number, naturalselection will favor the genotype with lower variance. In such cases, the average growth rate is not sufficient as a measure of fitness or as a predictor of fixation probability. However, the effect of variance in offspring number on the fixationprobability of mutant strategies has been calculated under several scenarios with the general conclusion that variance in offspring number reduces fitness in proportion to the inverse of the population size [Gillespie, J., Genetics 76:601-606, 1974; Proulx, S.R., Theor. Popul. Biol. 58:33-47, 2000]. This relationship becomes more complicated under a metapopulation scenario where the "effective" population size depends on migration rate, population structure, and lifecycle. It is shown that in a life cycle where reproduction and migration (the birth-migration-regulation life cycle, or BMR)occur prior to density regulation within every deme, the fitness of a strategy depends on migration rate. When migration rates are near zero, the fitness of the strategy is determined by the size of individual demes, so that the strategy favoredin small populations tends to be fixed. As migration rate increases and approaches panmixis between demes, the fitness ofa reproductive strategy approaches what its value would be in a single, panmictic deme with a population size correspondingtothe census size of the metapopulation. Interestingly, when the life cycle is characterized by having density regulation in each deme prior to migration (the BRM life cycle) the fixation probability of a strategy is independent of migration rate. These results are found to be qualitatively consistent with the individual-based simulation results in Shpak [Theor. Biosci.124:65-85, 2005].},

Because behaviour mediates interactions between an individual and its environment, the ability of organisms to behave appropriately under these new conditions is crucial for determining their immediate success or failure in these modified environments. While hundreds of species are suffering dramatically from these environmental changes, others, such as urbanized and pest species, are doing better than ever. Our goal is to provide insights into explaining such variation. We first summarize the responses of some species to novel situations, including novel risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation, pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework for predicting variation in behavioural responses to environmental change, drawing from models of decision-making processes and an understanding of the selective background against which they evolved. Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate, learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful, although these mechanisms are also constrained by evolutionary history. Although predicting the responses of species to environmental change is difficult, we highlight the need for a better understanding of the role of evolutionary history in shaping individuals' responses to their environment and provide suggestion for future work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The synergetic effects of recent rising atmospheric CO(2) and temperature are expected to favor tree growth in boreal and temperate forests. However, recent dendrochronological studies have shown site-specific unprecedented growth enhancements or declines. The question of whether either of these trends is caused by changes in the atmosphere remains unanswered because dendrochronology alone has not been able to clarify the physiological basis of such trends.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we combined standard dendrochronological methods with carbon isotopic analysis to investigate whether atmospheric changes enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) and growth of two deciduous and two coniferous tree species along a 9 degrees latitudinal gradient across temperate and boreal forests in Ontario, Canada. Our results show that although trees have had around 53\% increases in WUE over the past century, growth decline (measured as a decrease in basal area increment--BAI) has been the prevalent response in recent decades irrespective of species identity and latitude. Since the 1950s, tree BAI was predominantly negatively correlated with warmer climates and/or positively correlated with precipitation, suggesting warming induced water stress. However, where growth declines were not explained by climate, WUE and BAI were linearly and positively correlated, showing that declines are not always attributable to warming induced stress and additional stressors may exist.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show an unexpected widespread tree growth decline in temperate and boreal forests due to warming induced stress but are also suggestive of additional stressors. Rising atmospheric CO2 levels during the past century resulted in consistent increases in water use efficiency, but this did not prevent growth decline. These findings challenge current predictions of increasing terrestrial carbon stocks under climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of tree-ring carbon isotope composition ({$\delta$}(13)C) has been widely used to estimate spatio-temporal variations in intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of tree species. Numerous studies have reported widespread increases in iWUE coinciding with rising atmospheric CO(2) over the past century. While this could represent a coherent global response, the fact that increases of similar magnitude were observed across biomes with no apparent effect on tree growth raises the question of whether iWUE calculations reflect actual physiological responses to elevated CO(2) levels.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODOLOGY/RESULTS: Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to test if an artifact of calculation could explain observed increases in iWUE. We show that highly significant positive relationships between iWUE and CO(2) occur even when simulated data (randomized {$\delta$}(13)C values spanning the observed range) are used in place of actual tree-ring {$\delta$}(13)C measurements. From simulated data sets we calculated non-physiological changes in iWUE from 1900 to present and across a 4000 m altitudinal range. This generated results strikingly similar to those reported in recent studies encompassing 22 species from tropical, subtropical, temperate, boreal and mediterranean ecosystems. Only 6 of 49 surveyed case studies showed increases in iWUE significantly higher than predicted from random values.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results reveal that increases in iWUE estimated from tree-ring {$\delta$}(13)C occur independently of changes in (13)C discrimination that characterize physiological responses to elevated CO(2). Due to a correlation with CO(2) concentration, which is used as an independent factor in the iWUE calculation, any tree-ring {$\delta$}(13)C data set would inevitably generate increasing iWUE over time. Therefore, although consistent, previously reported trends in iWUE do not necessarily reflect a coherent global response to rising atmospheric CO(2). We discuss the significance of these findings and suggest ways to distinguish real from artificial responses in future studies.},

  abstract = {We consider a simple stochastic model for the dynamics of mixed-species waterfowl aggregations and describe two methods for assessing the fit of this model to field data. The model does not incorporate species-specific behavior. It assumes that all birds act independently and incorrectly predicts an exponential distribution for inter-event times. We reject this model, show that 29\% of the birds move in groups of two or more birds, and demonstrate that the distribution of inter-event times between the movements of groups of birds is exponential. We find no difference in movement rates or group sizes between seasons, and no difference between groups arriving into or departing from the observed aggregations. An analysis of group composition suggests that species at low abundance behave differently than species at high abundance: birds with few conspecifics are more likely to move in mixed-species groups than birds with many conspecifics. We suggest that simple stochastic models provide a useful way to explore the dynamics of animal behavior.},

We suggest that the contribution to the overall load is mainly local or regional, but with intermittent long distance transport (LDT) from more remote agricultural areas. This hypothesis is supported by investigating a 10 yr bi-hourly record of Alternaria spores in the air from Copenhagen. This record shows 232 clinically relevant episodes (daily average spore concentration above 100 m-3) with a distinct daily profile. The data analysis also revealed potential LDT episodes almost every year. A source map and analysis of atmospheric transport suggest that LDT always originates from the main agricultural areas in Central Europe. A dedicated emission study in cereal crops under harvest during 2010 also supports our hypothesis. The emission study showed that although the fields had been treated against fungal infections, harvesting still produced large amounts of airborne fungal spores. It is likely that such harvesting periods can cause clinically relevant levels of fungal spores in the atmosphere. Our findings suggest that crop harvest in Central Europe causes episodes of high airborne Alternaria spore concentrations in Copenhagen as well as other urban areas in this region. It is likely that such episodes could be simulated using atmospheric transport models.},

The seed orchard consisted of 49 parents (clones). Cone-crop management included bloom delay and supplemental mass pollination (SMP) using 12 internal and 4 external pollen donors. A random sample of 801 bulk seeds was genotyped for both haploid megagametophyte and corresponding diploid embryo. Using the parental population's multilocus genotypes, full pedigree reconstruction generated all the information needed to estimate the maternal, paternal, and parental reproductive success, selfing, pollen contamination, and pollination success of the 4 external pollen donors. Maternal, paternal, and parental reproductive success varied with 80\% of gametes being produced by 23, 45, and 37\% of the orchard's parents, respectively, resulting in a drastically reduced effective population size as compared to the census number (14 vs. 53). Selfing, pollen contamination, and aggregate SMP success (internal and external) were estimated to be 15.2, 10.4, and 15.0\%, respectively. Full pedigree reconstruction was effective in unraveling the orchard's pollination dynamics and both female and male reproductive success.},

Highly variable simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers  make it possible to accurately measure pollen contamination and  characterize patterns of within-orchard mating by directly identifying  the male and female parent of each seed produced in the orchard. We used  nine SSR markers to measure pollen contamination and characterize mating  patterns based on seed samples collected in 3 years (1999, 2000, and  2003) from one block of a nonisolated, open-pollinated, clonal seed  orchard of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in western  Oregon. Pollen contamination was consistently high across the 3 years  (mean = 35.3\%, range = 31.0\%-41.3\%) and appeared to result primarily from  cross-pollination among the orchard blocks. Levels of pollen  contamination varied substantially among clones and were higher in clones  with early female receptivity (mean = 55.5\%) than in those with either  mid (mean = 36.4\%) or late (mean = 28.3\%) female receptivity. We detected  low rates of self-pollination (mean = 1.8\% per clone) and over 10-fold  differences in the relative paternal contributions of the clones. There  was a clear pattern of positive assortative mating with respect to floral  phenology. This study illustrates that SSR markers are powerful tools for  characterizing seed lots and improving the design and management of  Douglas-fir seed orchards.},

Here we argue that integral projection models (IPM), and matrix approximations of them, provide a powerful approach to integrate population ecology, life history theory, and evolution.

A study of the frequency of initition of seed development and filled seeds in 17 stands of lodgepole pine differing in spacing and growth form of trees indicates that both the quantity of pollen produced by a tree and the density of conspecific individuals influence the frequency of filled seeds. Moreover, the positioning of a cone relative to the top and bottom or windward and leeward sides of a tree influences the frequency of filled seeds. Genetic markers used in controlled crosses indicate that cross pollen fertilizes significantly more than half the filled seeds resulting from crosses with equal mixes of self and cross pollen. The effect of density ofconspecifics and growth form of trees on the frequency of filled seeds gives an adaptive basis for the facultative shift in sex ratio in lodgepole pine. It also suggests an adaptive basis for the high frequency of dioecy in the wind-pollinated, woody perennials of the Great Basin Region. This relationship also has practical implications for the management of breeding systems for seed production and reforestation.},

Cuttings were collected from two habitats (calcareous and non-calcareous) within 15 regions in the British Isles. Two ramets of each plant were propagated and planted in untreated (bare clay substrate) and treated plots (with topsoil). We investigated the eVect of geographical and ecological distance on plant survival, size and fecundity. Local plants had greatest survival on the treated plots although this was not the case on the untreated plots where other provenances also performed well. In addition, there was a signiWcant, albeit very weak, negative relationship between survival and geographical distance on the treated plots and plant size and fecundity on the untreated plots. In contrast, the eVect of ecological distance was only signiWcant for plant size on the untreated plot; plants from more ecologically distant populations were larger and more fecund. This result was unexpected and may reXect adaptations amongst chalk grassland ecotypes (e.g. dwarWng) to extreme conditions (e.g. drought). Cyanogenesis, which has previously been linked to aspects of plant Wtness, was not shown to have an eVect on plant performance. In conclusion, this study suggests that there are regional diVerences between populations of L. corniculatus which may aVect the performance of plants in re-creation schemes. Ecological provenance may also inXuence the Wtness of plants when translocated. However, there was no evidence to support a consistent home-site advantage of local genotypes. Further long-term studies on a range of species are necessary.},

However, the storage effect depends on temporally fluctuating demographic rates, such as interannually variable germination rates. Because variable demographic rates often reduce fitness, we asked how a storage effect might evolve. Using a model of competing annual plants, we find that variable germination (and hence a storage effect) can evolve only if germination is positively correlated with high-fecundity years (predictive germination) or if one species has limited ability to evolve. Outside of these conditions, the storage effect is evolutionarily unstable: if two species were thrown together with traits that would permit a storage effect, they would coevolve constant germination rates and the storage effect would vanish. Our results suggest that for the temporal storage effect to be widespread, either germination must commonly be positively correlated with later growth or fecundity or community assembly must reflect biogeographic processes more than they do coevolution.},

We find that fluctuations depress growth only slightly ({$\sim$}2\%), but the effect would be much stronger for an organism that spawned only part of the year. Larval behavior can also matter, as vertical migration allows larvae to become entrained in eddies. Eddies synchronize connectivity fluctuations, further decreasing growth. However, here, they also divide the Keys into largely independently fluctuating regions, mitigating the effects of local synchrony. Therefore, in situations where connectivity fluctuations matter, the presence of independently fluctuating regions due to larval behavior may be important.},

Since the model's first projections were pub- lished in 2003, substantial improvements have been made to the model, and improved estimates of the probability distributions of uncertain input parameters have become available. The new projections are considerably warmer than the 2003 projections; for example, the median surface warming in 2091\textendash{}2100 is 5.18C compared to 2.48C in the earlier study. Many changes contribute to the stronger warming; among the more important ones are taking into account the cooling in the second half of the twentieth century due to volcanic eruptions for input parameter estimation and a more sophisticated method for projecting gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which eliminated many low-emission scenarios. However, if recently published data, suggesting stronger twentieth-century ocean warming, are used to deter- mine the input climate parameters, the median projected warming at the end of the twenty-first century is only 4.18C. Nevertheless, all ensembles of the simulations discussed here produce a much smaller probability of warming less than 2.48C than implied by the lower bound of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) projected likely range for the A1FI scenario, which has forcing very similar to the medianprojectioninthis study.Theprobabilitydistributionfor the surface warmingproducedby this analysis is more symmetric than the distribution assumed by theIPCCbecause of a different feedback between the climate and the carbon cycle, resulting from the inclusion in thismodel of the carbon\textendash{}nitrogen interaction in the terrestrial ecosystem.},

Previous results had shown higher natural selfing rates and lower inbreeding depression in embryo survival in A than in B + C. In the nursery test, selfing decreased means of size traits, retarded phenological development. increased variance among families within populations, increased the coefficient of within-family variance, and increased within-family skewness, The selfing depression of mean values was moderately less and the selfing inflation of within-plot variation was much less in A than in B + C. Results were compatible with the idea that the higher selfing rate in A had purged both severely deleterious alleles affecting embryo survival and severely deleterious alleles affecting later life-cycle traits related to plant size. Purging partially mitigated the genetic consequences associated with increased inbreeding in small populations. but even with purging, population A retained a large inbreeding depression in both embryonic and seedling traits.},

  abstract = {Synthesis Impending climate changes beg the question: which populations and species will go extinct and which will persist under future environmental conditions? When tolerance in situ is not possible, then species must undergo range shifts to avoid extinction. This synthesis explores ways in which directional air and water flow could impede such redistribution and the characteristics that might allow species to disperse against the flow. Considering flow patterns in tandem with climate and range projections has the potential to improve predictions of persistence for the earth's many non-moving foundation and basal species as well as the communities and food webs that they support. Predicting which populations and species will persist (i.e. avoid extinction and continue to exist) in the face of climate change requires an understanding of mechanisms that allow species to cope with altered environmental conditions. When processes of tolerance, acclimation, and adaptation are insufficient to allow persistence in situ, redistribution is required for population or species persistence. Here, I review evidence that directional flows of water and air have the potential to restrict species' range boundaries under ambient conditions, the spread of introduced species, and the redistribution of native species under changing climatic conditions. I develop the hypothesis that flow patterns, such as the speed and directionality (i.e. poleward vs equatorward) of asymmetric air and water currents, may need to be considered when assessing the vulnerability of populations and species to climate change. To the degree that directional flows are found to limit redistribution, there may be disproportionate losses of diversity where the dominant flow direction opposes that of shifting climate space. Within this context, I highlight flow conditions and life-history traits that could help the most passively-dispersed species redistribute to track changing climate. These predictions merit further examination in order to better anticipate which populations, species, and associated communities are likely to persist under climate change.},

TBB is strongly correlated with flowering time and is therefore probably mediated by assortative mating. We derived theoretical predictions and realized numerical simulations of evolutionary changes in TBB in response to divergent selection and gene flow in a metapopulation. We showed that the combination of the environmental gradient of TBB and assortative mating creates contrasting genetic clines, depending on the direction of divergent selection. If divergent selection acts in the same direction as the environmental gradient (cogradient settings), genetic clines are established and inflated by assortative mating. Conversely, under divergent selection of the same strength but acting in the opposite direction (countergradient selection), genetic clines are slightly constrained. We explored the consequences of these dynamics for population maladaptation, by monitoring pollen swamping. Depending on the direction of divergent selection with respect to the environmental gradient, pollen filtering owing to assortative mating either facilitates or impedes adaptation in peripheral populations.},

We developed a series of tree-ring chronologies from minimally disturbed sites across a spectrum of environmental conditions. A series of difference of means tests were used to compare radial growth post-1950, when the impacts of rising atmospheric CO2 are best expressed, with that pre-1950. Spearman's correlation was used to relate site stress to growth-rate changes. Significant increases in radial growth rates occurred post-1950, especially during drought years, with the greatest increases generally found at the most water-limited sites. Site harshness is positively related to enhanced radial growth rates. Atmospheric CO2 fertilization is probably operative, having a positive effect on radial growth rates of ponderosa pine through increasing water-use efficiency. A CO2-driven growth enhancement may affect ponderosa pine growing under both natural and controlled conditions.},

  abstract = {Measures of genetic structure among individuals or populations collected at different spatial locations across a landscape are commonly used as surrogate measures of functional (i.e. demographic or genetic) connectivity. In order to understand how landscape characteristics influence functional connectivity, resistance surfaces are typically created in a raster GIS environment. These resistance surfaces represent hypothesized relationships between landscape features and gene flow, and are based on underlying biological functions such as relative abundance or movement probabilities in different land cover types. The biggest challenge for calculating resistance surfaces is assignment of resistance values to different landscape features. Here, we first identify study objectives that are consistent with the use of resistance surfaces and critically review the various approaches that have been used to parameterize resistance surfaces and select optimal models in landscape genetics. We then discuss the biological assumptions and considerations that influence analyses using resistance surfaces, such as the relationship between gene flow and dispersal, how habitat suitability may influence animal movement, and how resistance surfaces can be translated into estimates of functional landscape connectivity. Finally, we outline novel approaches for creating optimal resistance surfaces using either simulation or computational methods, as well as alternatives to resistance surfaces (e.g. network and buffered paths). These approaches have the potential to improve landscape genetic analyses, but they also create new challenges. We conclude that no single way of using resistance surfaces is appropriate for every situation. We suggest that researchers carefully consider objectives, important biological assumptions and available parameterization and validation techniques when planning landscape genetic studies.},

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the influence of these modes on air temperature and precipitation in British Columbia (BC), Canada, can be explained in relation to changes in frequencies of synoptic-scale circulation types. A catalogue of 13 circulation types was derived by classifying daily mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) grids from 1948 to 2003. The grids cover BC and the North Pacific and were subjected to a standard pattern recognition algorithm employing principal component analysis followed by cluster analysis on the component scores. The circulation types are generally associated with distinctive patterns of precipitation and air temperature anomalies across BC. Multiple linear regressions for selected stations in BC using the type frequencies as predictors explain up to 75\% of the variance of mean winter temperature and 65\% of winter precipitation. The frequencies of most circulation types vary significantly between the different phases of ENSO, PDO and PNA in a manner consistent with the temperature anomalies associated with those modes and, to a lesser extent, with the more complex precipitation anomalies. In addition, however, average temperatures and precipitation amounts for some circulation types differ systematically between phases of ENSO and PDO. Subsequent analysis revealed distinct differences among ENSO and PDO phases in the upper-level circulation patterns associated with some surface types. A major part of the teleconnections can be explained through variations in the frequencies of synoptic-scale circulation types, but systematic within-type variability, particularly with PDO and PNA, can additionally influence the surface climate.

  abstract = {Since its introduction into the biomedical literature, statistical significance testing (abbreviated as SST) caused much debate. The aim of this perspective article is to review frequent fallacies and misuses of SST in the biomedical field and to review a potential way out of the fallacies and misuses associated with SSTs. Two frequentist schools of statistical inference merged to form SST as it is practised nowadays: the Fisher and the Neyman-Pearson school. The P-value is both reported quantitatively and checked against the alpha-level to produce a qualitative dichotomous measure (significant/nonsignificant). However, a P-value mixes the estimated effect size with its estimated precision. Obviously, it is not possible to measure these two things with one single number. For the valid interpretation of SSTs, a variety of presumptions and requirements have to be met. We point here to four of them: study size, correct statistical model, correct causal model, and absence of bias and confounding. It has been stated that the P-value is perhaps the most misunderstood statistical concept in clinical research. As in the social sciences, the tyranny of SST is still highly prevalent in the biomedical literature even after decades of warnings against SST. The ubiquitous misuse and tyranny of SST threatens scientific discoveries and may even impede scientific progress. In the worst case, misuse of significance testing may even harm patients who eventually are incorrectly treated because of improper handling of P-values. For a proper interpretation of study results, both estimated effect size and estimated precision are necessary ingredients.},

  abstract = {It is often assumed that the geographic distributions of species match their climatic tolerances, but this assumption is not frequently tested. Moreover, few studies examine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors for limiting species ranges. We combined multiple approaches to assess the extent to which fitness of a widespread native annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, decreases at and beyond its northern and western range edges, and how this is influenced by the presence of neighbors. First, we examined plant fitness and the effect of neighbors in natural populations at different geographic range locations for three years. Fitness decreased toward the northern range edge, but not the western edge. Neighbor removal had a consistently positive effect on seedpod production across all years and sites. Second, we established experimental populations at sites within the range, and at and beyond the northern and western range edges. We tracked individual fitness and recorded seedling recruitment in the following year (a complete generation) to estimate population growth rate. Individual fitness and population growth declined to near zero beyond both range edges, indicating that C. fasciculata with its present genetic composition will not establish in these regions, given conditions currently. We also carried out a neighbor removal treatment. Consistent with the natural populations, neighbors reduced seedpod production of reproductive adults. However, neighbors also increased early-season survival, and this positive effect early in life history resulted in a net positive effect of neighbors on lifetime fitness at most range locations. Our data show that the population growth rate of C. fasciculata includes values above replacement, and populations are well adapted to conditions up to the edge of the range, whereas the severely compromised fitness at sites beyond the edge precludes immediate establishment of populations and thereby impedes adaptation to these conditions.},

To explore how fitness of the native plant Chamaecrista fasciculata depends on habitat within, at and beyond its range edge, we planted seeds from five populations in two soil substrates at these geographic locations. We found that with reduced competition, lifetime fitness was always greater or equivalent in one habitat type, loam soils, though early-season survival was greater on sand soils. At the range edge, natural populations are typically found on sand soil habitats, which are also less competitive environments. Early-season survival and fitness differed among source populations, and when transplanted beyond the range edge, range edge populations had greater fitness than interior populations. Our results indicate that even when the optimal soil substrate for a species does not change with geographic range location, the realized niche of a species may be restricted to sub-optimal habitats at the range edge because of the combined effects of differences in abiotic and biotic effects (e.g. competitors) between substrates.},

  abstract = {Understanding how communities respond to extreme climatic events is important for predicting the impact of climate change on biodiversity. The plant vigor and stress hypotheses provide a theoretical framework for understanding how arthropods respond to stress, but are rarely tested at the community level. Following a record drought, we compared the communities of arthropods on pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) that exhibited a gradient in physical traits related to environmental stress (e.g., growth rate, branch dieback, and needle retention). Six patterns emerged that show how one of the predicted outcomes of climate change in the southwestern USA (i.e., increased drought severity) alters the communities of a foundation tree species. In accordance with the plant vigor hypothesis, increasing tree stress was correlated with an eight to tenfold decline in arthropod species richness and abundance. Trees that were more similar in their level of stress had more similar arthropod communities. Both foliage quantity and quality contributed to arthropod community structure. Individual species and feeding groups differed in their responses to plant stress, but most were negatively affected. Arthropod richness (r(2) = 0.48) and abundance (r(2) = 0.48) on individual trees were positively correlated with the tree's radial growth during drought. This relationship suggests that tree ring analysis may be used as a predictor of arthropod diversity, which is similar to findings with ectomycorrhizal fungi. A contrast of our findings on arthropod abundance with published data on colonization by mutualistic fungi on the same trees demonstrates that at low stress these two communities respond differently, but at high stress both are negatively affected. These results suggest that the effect of extreme climatic events such as drought on foundation tree species are likely to decrease multi-trophic diversity and shift arthropod community composition, which in turn could cascade to affect other associated taxa.},

Researchers in this field can combine the high resolution of genetic markers with spatial data and a variety of statistical methods to evaluate the role that landscape variables play in shaping genetic diversity and population structure. While interest in this research area is growing rapidly, our ability to fully utilize landscape data, test explicit hypotheses and truly integrate these diverse disciplines has lagged behind. Part of the current challenge in the development of the field of landscape genetics is bridging the communication and knowledge gap between these highly specific and technical disciplines. The goal of this review is to help bridge this gap by exposing geneticists to terminology, sampling methods and analysis techniques widely used in landscape ecology and spatial statistics but rarely addressed in the genetics literature. We offer a definition for the term "landscape genetics", provide an overview of the landscape genetics literature, give guidelines for appropriate sampling design and useful analysis techniques, and discuss future directions in the field. We hope, this review will stimulate increased dialog and enhance interdisciplinary collaborations advancing this exciting new field.},

Optimal defence theory predicts that plant tissues most closely tied to plant fitness should be most defended at the constitutive level, and that more expendable tissues should be inducible with damage. 2 We examined variation in glucosinolate content between leaves and petals, as well as among four petal colour morphs of wild radish, Raphanus sativus . We predicted greater levels of constitutive defences in petals, and greater inducibility of glucosinolates in leaves, based on previous studies that could relate leaves and petals to plant fitness. 3 While, overall, optimal defence predictions were supported, individual glucosinolates differed in both their degree of inducibility as well as in their distribution between tissue types. 4 Petal colour variants differed in their induced responses to damage, but not in their constitutive levels of compounds. Yellow and white morphs, which are preferred by the dominant bee pollinators as well as by herbivores, were generally less inducible than anthocynanin-containing pink and bronze petal morphs. 5 Pleiotropic effects between petal colour and defence loci, or tight linkage between these loci, may allow pollinators to maintain variation in secondary chemistry, as well as allow herbivores to influence colour morph fitness and prevalence.},

The portion of the atmosphere most affected by that boundary is called the atmospheric boundary layer or boundary layer for short. The thickness of the boundary layer is quite variable in space and time. Turbulence and static stability conspire to sandwich a strong stable layer called a capping inversion between the boundary layer below and the rest of the troposphere above called the free atmosphere. This stable layer traps turbulence, pollutants, and moisture below it and prevents most of the surface friction from being felt by the free atmosphere. Turbulence is ubiquitous within the boundary layer and is responsible for efficiently dispersing the pollutants that accompany modern life. Turbulent communication between the surface and the air is quite rapid, allowing the air to quickly take on characteristics of the underlying surface. In fact, one definition of the boundary layer is that portion of the lower troposphere that feels the effects of the underlying surface within about 30 min or less. Turbulence is inspiringly complex, consisting of a superposition of swirls called ``eddies'' that interact nonlinearly to create quasi-random, chaotic motions. An infinite number of equations are required to fully describe these motions. Hence, a complete solution has not been found.},

Two double-blind studies have demonstrated the efficacy of topiramate for CM prevention, but it is not FDA-approved for this indi-cation. Treatments in development for migraine will also be reviewed. Advancements in the understanding of migraine pathogenesis have identified new targets for both acute and preventive treatment and have engendered the development of targeted and mechanism-based therapies. The need for more effective treatment for CM patients, which has long since been identified, is now being addressed. Several of the emerging treatments for migraine prevention are under investigation specifically for CM or high-frequency episodic migraine.},

  abstract = {Environmental conditions and biotic interactions are generally thought to influence local species richness. However, immigration and the evolutionary and historical factors that shape regional species pools should also contribute to determining local species richness because local communities arise by assembly from regional species pools. Using the European tree flora as our study system, we implemented a novel approach to assess the relative importance of local and regional mechanisms that control local species richness. We first identified species pools that tolerate particular local environments and quantified the proportion of the pool that is present locally, i.e. the realized/potential (R/P) richness ratio. Because no consensus exists on how to estimate potential richness, we estimated it using three different approaches. Using these three estimates separately and in a combined ensemble estimate, we then analyzed the effects of potential drivers on R/P richness ratios. We predicted that the R/P richness ratio would 1) increase with decreasing distance from glacial refugia (accessibility), 2) and be generally low in geographically fragmented southern Europe because of dispersal limitation; 3) increase with actual evapotranspiration because greater availability of water and energy promotes local population persistence; and 4) increase with topographic heterogeneity because it promotes local species coexistence and facilitates long-term species survival. There was considerable variation among the three R/P richness ratio estimates, but we found consistent support for a negative effect of regional geographic fragmentation and a positive topographic effect. We also identified fairly broad support for the predicted effect of accessibility. We conclude that local tree assemblages in Europe often fail to realize a large proportion of the potential richness held in the regional species pool, partially reflecting their geographical, historical, and environmental circumstances. The dispersal-related effects of geographic fragmentation and accessibility exemplify regional controls that combine with local ecological sorting to determine local species richness.},

Several climate models predict that the intercontinental western United States will experience an increase in extreme precipitation events and warming temperatures. In 1996, northern Arizona, USA, experienced a 100-year drought that caused high local mortality of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), a dominant tree of the southwest. We compared trunk growth, water potentials, and ectomycorrhizal dynamics for surviving trees at three high-mortality sites and adjacent low-mortality sites. Four major patterns emerged. First, surviving trees at sites that suffered high mortality exhibited reduced long-term growth and increased water stress relative to adjacent sites where little or no mortality occurred. Second, surviving trees from high-mortality sites had 50\% lower ectomycorrhizal colonization and showed a pronounced shift in fungal community composition relative to low-mortality sites. Third, in support of an intermediate-host plant stress hypothesis, trees that experienced intermediate levels of stress supported two-fold greater ectomycorrhizal colonization than trees at the high or low end of a stress gradient. Fourth, we observed a strong correlation between trunk growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization and validated the resulting regression model with independent data. This relationship suggests that tree rings can be used to reconstruct past and predict future ectomycorrhizal colonization. Overall, our findings suggest that predicted climate changes might be accompanied by both qualitative and quantitative changes in ectomycorrhizal dynamics that could affect ecosystems by altering nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics, and host-plant performance.},

Pinyons growing in ash and cinder soils experienced much greater water and nutrient stress than pinyons growing nearby in sandyloam soils. Over a one year period, we obtained monthly measurements of ECM colonization, root zone soil moisture and temperature, and air temperature and precipitation. Four major patterns emerged. Firstly, although climate as measured by ambient temperature and precipitation did not vary between the two sites, soil temperature was significantly higher and soil moisture significantly lower at the cinder site than at the sandy-loam site. Secondly, ECM colonization was significantly higher at the cinder site for 5 of 12 months. Thirdly, although nearly 70 \% of the variation in ECM colonization of pinyons growing in cinder soil was predicted by a combination of soil moisture and soil temperature, these same variables had little predictive power for pinyons growing in sandy-loam soils. Air temperature and precipitation were also significantly correlated with ECM colonization at the cinder site but not the sandy-loam site. Fourthly, a watering experiment showed that ECM colonization significantly increased with supplemental water at the cinder site, but not at the sandy-loam site. Thus, in two sites that did not differ in plant community or climate, ectomycorrhizas in cinder soils were far more sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature than ectomycorrhizas in sandy-loam soils.},

  abstract = {Patches, gradients, and hierarchies are three common organizational frameworks for assessing the effects of spatial heterogeneity on species distributions. Since these frameworks are often chosen a priori, without knowledge of study systems, they may not correspond to the empirical heterogeneity present and may result in partial or erroneous conclusions about the forces structuring species distributions. I tested the consequences of choosing particular frameworks and whether patch heterogeneity structured patchily distributed populations of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) along four rivers in California's Central Valley (USA). A comparison of the three approaches revealed that each led to incomplete conclusions about controls on the beetle's distribution and populations. Patch analysis revealed weak effects of patch size and quality, and high unexplained variance, which likely reveals large amounts of stochasticity since replication was high. The patch analysis therefore concluded that distributions consistent with patch dynamic structures like classic metapopulation, source\textendash{}sink, and mainland\textendash{}island models existed in the different rivers. Conversely, gradient analyses revealed a gradientdistribution pattern responding to continuous and often large-scale variables, such as hostplant age or size, water availability, and the presence of an invasive leguminous tree; again most variance in beetle occurrence remained unexplained. Hierarchical analysis identified the natural spatial patterns of the system but gave no indication of causal processes. The combination of all three approaches explained the maximum variance in beetle occurrence, through inclusion of a comprehensive list of explanatory variables, multiple spatial scales, various types of heterogeneity, and a focus on the scales at which beetle\textendash{}environment interactions were strongest. Surprisingly, these results still supported the notion that the beetle exists as a metapopulation, a structure thought to be rare because it ignores habitat quality and landscape conditions. These analyses exemplify the simultaneous importance of local patch attributes and broad-scale and/or gradient variables that are commonly overlooked in patch studies. Importantly, some patch attributes acted over inter-patch scales, affecting the perception of patch distances and distributional extents. Only through the integration of frameworks was I able to decipher the system's complexity and see that all three types of heterogeneity were acting in the system, sometimes over unexpected scales.},

Motivated by actual events we focus on flows in realistic urban geometry. Both deterministic and stochastic particle transport patterns have been identified, as inertial Lagrangian coherent structures. For the deterministic case, the organizing structures are well-defined and we extract them at different hours of a day to reveal the variability of coherent patterns. For the stochastic case, we use a random displacement model for fluid particles and derive the governing equation for inertial particles to examine the change in organizing structures due to ``zeroth-order'' random noise. We find that, (1) the Langevin equation for inertial particles can be reduced to a random displacement model; (2) using random noise based on inhomogeneous turbulence, whose diffusivity is derived from k - {$\epsilon$} models, major coherent structures survive to organize local flow patterns and weaker structures are smoothed out due to random motion.},

This genetic variation in precocity can be used to reduce the generation interval, thereby facilitating genetic studies and breeding programs.

Pigmentation variation is highly correlated with different ecological variables and is thought to reflect adaptations to different environments. Several studies have linked candidate genes from Drosophila melanogaster to intra-population variation and interspecific morphological divergence, but less clearly to variation among populations forming pigmentation clines. We characterized a new thoracic trident pigmentation cline in D. melanogaster populations from eastern Australia, and applied a candidate gene approach to explain the majority of the geographically structured phenotypic variation. More melanized populations from higher latitudes tended to express less ebony than their tropical counterparts, and an independent artificial selection experiment confirmed this association. By partitioning temperature dependent effects, we showed that the genetic differences underlying clinal patterns for trident variation at 25\hspace{1em}\textdegree{}C do not explain the patterns observed at 16\hspace{1em}\textdegree{}C. Changes in thoracic trident pigmentation could be a common evolutionary response to climatically mediated environmental pressures. On the Australian east coast most of the changes appear to be associated with regulatory divergence of the ebony gene but this depends on temperature.},

  abstract = {The primary function of fruit is to attract animals that disperse viable seeds, but the nutritional rewards that attract beneficial consumers also attract consumers that kill seeds instead of dispersing them. Many of these unwanted consumers are microbes, and microbial defense is commonly invoked to explain the bitter, distasteful, occasionally toxic chemicals found in many ripe fruits. This explanation has been criticized, however, due to a lack of evidence that microbial consumers influence fruit chemistry in wild populations. In the present study, we use wild chilies to show that chemical defense of ripe fruit reflects variation in the risk of microbial attack. Capsaicinoids are the chemicals responsible for the well known pungency of chili fruits. Capsicum chacoense is naturally polymorphic for the production of capsaicinoids and displays geographic variation in the proportion of individual plants in a population that produce capsaicinoids. We show that this variation is directly linked to variation in the damage caused by a fungal pathogen of chili seeds. We find that Fusarium fungus is the primary cause of predispersal chili seed mortality, and we experimentally demonstrate that capsaicinoids protect chili seeds from Fusarium. Further, foraging by hemipteran insects facilitates the entry of Fusarium into fruits, and we show that variation in hemipteran foraging pressure among chili populations predicts the proportion of plants in a population producing capsaicinoids. These results suggest that the pungency in chilies may be an adaptive response to selection by a microbial pathogen, supporting the influence of microbial consumers on fruit chemistry.},

Despite this, the cool margins of many species' distributions have expanded rapidly in association with recent climate warming. We examined four insect species that have expanded their geographical ranges in Britain over the past 20 years. Here we report that two butterfly species have increased the variety of habitat types that they can colonize, and that two bush cricket species show increased fractions of longer-winged (dispersive) individuals in recently founded populations. Both ecological and evolutionary processes are probably responsible for these changes. Increased habitat breadth and dispersal tendencies have resulted in about 3- to 15-fold increases in expansion rates, allowing these insects to cross habitat disjunctions that would have represented major or complete barriers to dispersal before the expansions started. The emergence of dispersive phenotypes will increase the speed at which species invade new environments, and probably underlies the responses of many species to both past and future climate change.},

An eco-evolutionary model predicts a similar relationship, suggesting that this pattern is the result of evolutionary adaptation. Using mechanistic species distribution models, we find that rising temperatures this century will cause poleward shifts in species' thermal niches and a sharp decline in tropical phytoplankton diversity in the absence of an evolutionary response.},

  abstract = {Protection of rare ecosystems requires information on their abundance and spatial distribution, yet mapping rare ecosystems, particularly those which are fragmented, is a challenge. Use of high spatial resolution satellite imagery is increasing, in part because it may be well-suited for mapping fine-scale components of landscapes. We classified high spatial resolution QuickBird imagery of coastal British Columbia, Canada into late seral forest associations. With an emphasis on rare forest associations, we compared the classification accuracies resulting from contrasting accuracy assessment techniques. We also evaluated the impact of post-classification image smoothing on the quantity and configuration of rare forest associations mapped. Less common associations were generally classified with lower accuracies than more abundant associations, however, accuracies varied depending on the assessment technique used. In particular, ignoring the presence of fine-scale heterogeneity falsely lowered the estimates of map accuracy by approximately 20\%. Smoothing, while generally increasing the accuracies of rare forest associations, had a large effect on their predicted spatial extent and configuration. Simply due to smoothing, areal estimates of rare associations differed by as much as 36\%, the number of patches decreased by 73\% on average, and mean patch size increased by up to 650\%. Our findings indicate that routinely used post-classification and map assessment techniques can greatly impact the portrayal of rare and fragmented ecosystems. Further research is needed on the specific challenges of mapping and assessing the accuracy of rare ecosystems in fragmented and heterogeneous landscapes.},

Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species,{\"A}{\^o} range shifts, changes in phenology and species,{\"A}{\^o} extinctions, accurate projections of species,{\"A}{\^o} responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species,{\"A}{\^o} responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species,{\"A}{\^o} distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the ,{\"A}{\'u}trailing edge,{\"A}{\`u} of shifting populations, species,{\"A}{\^o} interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species,{\"A}{\^o} distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species,{\"A}{\^o} migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species,{\"A}{\^o} distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world.},

  abstract = {A new computation framework (BIOMOD: BIOdiversity MODelling) is presented, which aims to maximize the predictive accuracy of current species distributions and the reliability of future potential distributions using different types of statistical modelling methods. BIOMOD capitalizes on the different techniques used in static modelling to provide spatial predictions. It computes, for each species and in the same package, the four most widely used modelling techniques in species predictions, namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CART) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). BIOMOD was applied to 61 species of trees in Europe using climatic quantities as explanatory variables of current distributions. On average, all the different modelling methods yielded very good agreement between observed and predicted distributions. However, the relative performance of different techniques was idiosyncratic across species, suggesting that the most accurate model varies between species. The results of this evaluation also highlight that slight differences between current predictions from different modelling techniques are exacerbated in future projections. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the reliability of alternative projections without validation techniques or expert opinion. It is concluded that rather than using a single modelling technique to predict the distribution of several species, it would be more reliable to use a framework assessing different models for each species and selecting the most accurate one using both evaluation methods and expert knowledge.},

  abstract = {The Uinta Mountains in the northwestern Colorado River Basin are an important source of water for Utah and the western United States. This article examines 20th Century hydrology in the Uinta Mountains region in the context of the previous four to eight centuries as well as possible relationships with Pacific and Atlantic Ocean variability using new tree-ring based reconstructions for streamflow and snowpack. The 20th Century appears to have been unusually wet compared with previous centuries. Relationships between hydrology in the region and the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) are largely insignificant in instrumental datasets but may have been stronger, although inconsistent, over the longer time spans represented by the paleoclimate records. Impacts of individual modes of sea surface temperature variability may sometimes be enhanced by periods when climate forcing by ENSO, PDO, and/or AMO coincide. Such episodes are associated with deviations from mean hydrology as high as +14\% and as low as -18\%. The 20th Century could be a misleading benchmark to base water resource estimates upon and flexible water management strategies are necessary to take into account the large range of natural variability observed in the longer-term hydroclimatology as well as the challenges to predictability due to the apparently complex and inconsistent influence of ocean-driven variability},

Genomic, phenotypic and climatic data were used to test assumptions of hybrid zone maintenance and to model future scenarios under climate change. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 86 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms were combined with long-term quantitative data on growth and survival (over 20 yr), as well as one-time assessments of bud burst and bud set phenology, and cold hardiness traits. A total of 15 498 individuals were phenotyped for growth and survival. Our results suggest that the P. glauca \texttimes{} P. engelmannii hybrid zone is maintained by local adaptation to growing season length and snowpack (exogenous selection). Hybrids appeared to be fitter than pure species in intermediate environments, which fits expectations of the bounded hybrid superiority model of hybrid zone maintenance. Adaptive introgression from parental species has probably contributed to increased hybrid fitness in intermediate habitats. While P. engelmannii ancestry is higher than P. glauca ancestry in hybrid populations, on average, selective breeding in managed hybrid populations is shifting genomic composition towards P. glauca, potentially pre-adapting managed populations to warmer climates.},

We studied atmospheric and surface pollen deposition rates of Yungas trees along an altitudinal gradient (1700\textendash{}3800 m a.s.l.) to understand the role of local wind patterns in modern pollen transport to mountain regions. Pollen from the Montane forest (Alnus and Juglans) and the Montane rainforest (Anadenanthera, Celtis and Myrtaceae) becomes airborne and is transported upslope well above the tree-line. The resulting patterns of pollen deposition show a secondary maximum in the Montane grassland, consistent with the development of a mountain-valley breeze system during the flowering period of the pollen producer species. Given that the pattern is also preserved in the surface sediment, we propose that these tree pollen types are good indicators of mesoscale atmospheric circulation and could provide a proxy for this circulation system in Quaternary records. This alternative approach to interpreting fossil pollen records of Yungas species in highlands of the Central Andes has implications for regional reconstructions of past climate.},

  abstract = {A growing body of empirical evidence demonstrates that at an expanding front, there can be strong selection for greater dispersal propensity, whereas recent theory indicates that mutations occurring towards the front of a spatially expanding population can sometimes 'surf' to high frequency and spatial extent. Here, we consider the potential interplay between these two processes: what role may mutation surfing play in determining the course of dispersal evolution and how might dispersal evolution itself influence mutation surfing? Using an individual-based coupled-map lattice model, we first run simulations to determine the fate of dispersal mutants that occur at an expanding front. Our results highlight that mutants that have a slightly higher dispersal propensity than the wild type always have a higher survival probability than those mutants with a dispersal propensity lower than, or very similar to, the wild type. However, it is not always the case that mutants with very high dispersal propensity have the greatest survival probability. When dispersal mortality is high, mutants of intermediate dispersal survive most often. Interestingly, the rate of dispersal that ultimately evolves at an expanding front is often substantially higher than that which confers a novel mutant with the greatest probability of survival. Second, we run a model in which we allow dispersal to evolve over the course of a range expansion and ask how the fate of a neutral or nonneutral mutant depends upon when and where during the expansion it arises. These simulations highlight that the success of a neutral mutant depends upon the dispersal genotypes that it is associated with. An important consequence of this is that novel mutants that arise at the front of an expansion, and survive, typically end up being associated with more dispersive genotypes than the wild type. These results offer some new insights into causes and the consequences of dispersal evolution during range expansions, and the methodology we have employed can be readily extended to explore the evolutionary dynamics of other life history characteristics.},

  abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta- population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection\textendash{}diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory\textemdash{}an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50\textendash{}150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island `stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connect- ing distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be priori- tized for marine conservation efforts.},

Such reconstructions, however, have been hindered by a lack of experiments that separate the influences of confounding impacts on tree rings, such as herbivores and the interactions of multiple factors. Our long-term experiments with scale insects on resistant and susceptible pines demonstrate three major points that are important to the application of this commonly used tool. (i) Herbivory reduced tree ring growth by 25-35\%. (ii) The impact on ring growth distorted climate reconstruction, resulting in the overestimation of past moisture levels by more than 2-fold. Our data suggest that, if distortion because of herbivory has been a problem in previous reconstructions, estimates of the magnitude of recent climate changes are likely to be conservative. (iii) Our studies support a detectible plant resistance x herbivore x climate interaction in the tree ring record. Because resistance and susceptibility to herbivory are known to be genetically based in many systems, the potential exists to incorporate plant genetics into the field of dendrochronology, where it may be used to screen distortions from the tree ring record.},

In each case, a unique typology of land cover and aquatic resources was developed and relevant economic valuation studies were queried in order to assign estimates of ecosystem service values to each category in the typology. The result was a set of unique standardized ecosystem service value coefficients broken down by land cover class and service type for each case study. GIS analysis was then used to map the spatial distribution of each cover class at each study site. Economic values were summarized and mapped by tributary basin for Massachusetts and California and by property parcel for Maury Island. For Maury Island, changes in ecosystem service value flows were estimated under two alternative development scenarios. Drawing on lessons learned during the implementation of the case studies, the authors present some of the practical challenges that accompany spatially explicit ecosystem service value transfer. They also discuss how variability in the site characteristics and data availability for each project limits the ability to generalize a single comprehensive methodology.},

Lawn resilience was assessed using a chroma meter to measure browning and greening. All replicate plots recovered to pre-drought green colour after a 3-month induced summer drought. The use of fertiliser in spring lead to greater susceptibility to browning during drought and slower recovery but post-drought fertiliser application tended to aid recovery. Returning grass clippings to the surface led to an increased resistance to browning during drought, aided faster recovery and lowered levels of nitrate leaching. We conclude that under the conditions tested, the lawn plots showed a high degree of physical resilience which could be enhanced by management approaches.},

Osmotic adjustment was assessed by pressure-volume analysis of shoots and by analysis of soluble carbohydrates and free amino acids in roots during the last drying cycle. In well-watered seedlings, elevated CO(2) increased the concentration of soluble sugars in roots by 68\%. Water stress reduced the soluble sugar concentration in roots of seedling growing in ambient CO(2) to 26\% of that in roots of well-watered seedlings. Elevated CO(2) mitigated the water stress-induced decrease in the concentration of soluble sugars in roots. However, this was probably due, in part, to carbohydrate loading during the first four months when all seedlings were grown in the presence of a high water supply, rather than to osmotic adjustment to water stress. Water stress caused a doubling in the concentration of free primary amino acids in roots, whereas elevated CO(2) reduced primary amino acid and nitrogen concentrations to 32 and 74\%, respectively, of those in roots of seedlings grown in ambient CO(2).

Due to annual variability in pollen levels, there is a need to develop a precise forecasting model that can accurately predict levels of annual airborne pollen for use by patients and medical personnel. In a previous study, we developed and tested a new pollen prediction algorithm based on past meteorological conditions in a flat region. In this study, we analyzed pollen samples (spring 1997\textendash{}2016) and meteorological data (summer 1991\textendash{}2015) from nine Swiss cities, using the algorithm to test its applicability in a mountainous region. However, we found variations in model applicability (r2 and RMSE) among the nine observation sites. Based on considerations of topographical influence on the spatial representativeness of airborne pollen data, we then investigated the relationships between these indices and topographical features at varying spatial ranges. The results suggested that the applicability of the algorithm to annual total airborne pollen forecasts can indicate the spatial representativeness of observed airborne pollen concentrations: r2 and RMSE reflected deviations in airborne pollen concentration caused by dispersal conditions at local and meso-scales, respectively. At higher-altitude monitoring sites, the local spatial representativeness of airborne pollen declined due to the influence of local topography-driven climate. On the other hand, dispersal conditions in the atmospheric boundary layer may deteriorate the meso-scale representativeness of airborne pollen at monitoring sites with higher terrain complexity. This study provides a reference approach to determining the spatial representativeness of airborne pollen data by applying the pollen forecast algorithm.},

Development of pattern metrics has largely stabilized, and they are widely used to relate landscape pattern to ecological responses. Analyses conducted at multiple scales have demonstrated the importance of landscape pattern for many taxa, and spatially mediated interspecific interactions are receiving increased attention. Disturbance remains prominent in landscape studies, and current research is addressing disturbance interactions. Integration of ecosystem and landscape ecology remains challenging but should enhance understanding of landscape function. Landscape ecology should continue to refine knowledge of when spatial heterogeneity is fundamentally important, rigorously test the ...},

Process-based models, which are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes, provide a useful framework to incorporate specific responses to altered environmental conditions. As a result, these models can offer significant advantages in predicting the effects of global change as compared to purely statistical or rule-based models based on previously collected data. Process-based models also offer more explicitly stated assumptions and easier interpretation than detailed simulation models. We provide guidelines for identifying the appropriate type of model and level of complexity for management decisions. Finally we outline some of those factors that make modeling for local and regional management under global change a particular challenge: changes to relevant scales and processes, additional sources of uncertainty, legacy effects, threshold dynamics, and socio-economic impacts.},

  abstract = {Monitoring contemporary gene flow from widespread exotic plantations is becoming an important problem in forest conservation genetics. In plants, where both seed and pollen disperse, three components of exotic gene flow with potentially unequal consequences should be, but have not been, explicitly distinguished: zygotic, male gametic and female gametic. Building on a previous model for estimating contemporary rates of zygotic and male gametic gene flow among plant populations, we present here an approach that additionally estimates the third (female gametic) gene flow component, based on a combination of uni- and biparentally inherited markers. Using this method and a combined set of chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites, we estimate gene flow rates from exotic plantations into two Iberian relict stands of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) and Scots pine (P. sylvestris). Results show neither zygotic nor female gametic gene flow but moderate (6-8\%) male gametic introgression for both species, implying significant dispersal of pollen, but not of seeds, from exotic plantations into native stands shortly after introduced trees reached reproductive maturity. Numerical simulation results suggest that the model yields reasonably accurate estimates for our empirical data sets, especially for larger samples. We discuss conservation management implications of observed levels of exposure to non-local genes, and identify research needs to determine potentially associated hazards. Our approach should be useful for plant ecologists and ecosystem managers interested in the vectors of contemporary genetic connectivity among discrete plant populations.

Likewise, genomic approaches are beginning to offer new insights into higher-level biological phenomena that previously occupied the realm of ecological investigation only.

  abstract = {Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

Heritable phenotypic plasticity in the timing of the phenophases can be of importance in the adaptation of woody species to a quickly changing environment. We observed the timing of bud burst, flower opening, leaf senescence and leaf fall in two successive years in a common garden of Crataegus monogyna Jacq. in Belgium, consisting of six local and five non-local provenances. Data were processed with cumulative logistic mixed models. Strong auto-correlation was present among the spring phenophases as well as among the autumnal phenophases, with spring phenophases being negatively correlated with fall phenophases. The strongest between-provenance differentiation was found for the timing of bud burst in spring, followed by flower opening and finally by leaf senescence and leaf fall. Warmer spring temperatures in March 2017 advanced the timing of bud burst, and to a lesser extent of flower opening, in all provenances compared to 2016. However, the advancement was non-linear among the provenances, with the lower latitude provenances being relatively less early and the higher elevation provenances being more late than the local provenances in this year. It can be hypothesized that non-local provenances display larger temporal phenotypic plastic responses in the timing of their spring phenophases compared to local provenances when temperatures in the common garden deviate more from their home-sites.},

Seven Belgian provenances were included, five in Flanders and two in Wallonia, completed with three commercial provenances originating from Italy, Hungary and the United Kingdom. A completely randomized design (single tree plots) was adopted. Data were processed using mixed modelling techniques. South European provenances flushed up to 7 days earlier than the Flemish provenances, whereas the Walloon provenances flushed 4 days later. Compared to the Flemish provenances, Southern provenances and Walloon provenances flowered 4 days earlier and 2 days later respectively. Height increment and shrub morphology did not vary significantly between the Belgian and commercial provenances. Bud burst varied less than flowering among the Flemish and the Walloon provenances. This possibly indicates a higher selection pressure on bud burst than on flowering. The higher time lag between the different provenances for bud burst in comparison to flowering indicates a stronger plastic response for the latter. The results point out the importance of bud burst as an indicator of local adaptation to geo-climatologic components. Finally, it appeared that old hedges are likely to be good sources of locally adapted seed.},

  abstract = {Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) is one of four species of corvids that commences harvesting, transporting, and caching the seeds of pinon pine (Pinus edulis) in mid\textemdash{}August. Caching continues until inclement weather intervenes or the seed crop is depleted. Nutcrackers are efficient at collecting seeds from the trees because the birds discriminate edible and aborted seeds, select cones with higher than average number of good seeds and appear to concentrate on those trees that produce cones with large numbers of good seeds. The use of a sublingual pouch allows the nutcracker to carry up to 95 pinon pine seeds per trip (x = 55). A pouch full of seeds may be carried as far as 22 km from the collecting area (the pinon\textemdash{}juniper woodland, elevation \textasciitilde{} 1800 m) to communal caching areas where the seeds are buried in clumps in subterranean caches at a depth of 2 to 3 cm. These caching areas are on steep, south\textemdash{}facing slopes that are usually free of snow by late winter. Although solitary nesters, the birds, during the nonbreeding season, often form flocks when harvesting seeds. A flock of 150 nutcrackers cached between 3.3\textemdash{}5.0 X 106 pinon pine seeds in the autumn of a good cone crop. Each bird caches between 2.2 and 3.3 X its needed energetic requirements for the insect\textemdash{}free portion of the year. Some of the unrecovered seeds germinated and grew. The pinon pine reaches its highest density in relatively dry areas below the elevational range of other members of the genus Pinus, but ranges up to 3,100 m into the mixed coniferous forest. This pine has developed a number of traits that enhance its efficiency to be located and dispersed by the birds. The seeds are unusually large, of high energy value, and have relatively thin seed coats. The large size improves the germination potential of the seed but also attracts predators and dispersal agents. The seed coat color is markedly different for edible and aborted seeds, thus labeling them for visually oriented seed harvesters. Most pinon pine cones are oriented outward and upward which increases illumination of the seeds and tends to hold them in the cone. The pinon pine displays the seeds in its cones more readily than wind\textemdash{}dispersed pines by opening the seed\textemdash{}bearing cone scales to a uniform angle. Pinon pine seeds are retained for a long period of time in the cone because they are held in deep depressions on the cone scales by small flanges. This constellation of features indicated an evolutionary strategy on the part of the pinon pine to exploit and encourage members of the seed\textemdash{}caching guild to disperse the seeds. Deposition sites are presumably more favorable for germination than those obtained by simply broadcasting the seeds over a wide area. Individual seedlings potentially experience immediate intraspecific competition because the seeds are cached in clumps. Only one seedling, presumably the strongest, fastest\textemdash{}growing individual, survives. The benefits of this system to the nutcracker are that the bird has a supply of energy for the most unproductive months of the year. The bird also breeds in late winter or early spring, using the stored seeds for reproductive energy.},

Here I report the results of a 2-year study on the influence of four seed-caching rodents (Perognathus parvus, Dipodomys panamintinus, Peromyscus truei, and Peromyscus maniculatus) on the dispersal of singleleaf pifion pine (Pinus monophylla) in western Nevada. During the moderate seed crop of autumn 1993, 11\% of the edible pifion seeds fell to the ground, and, during the heavy seed crop of autumn 1994, 57\% of the seeds fell. Rodents gathered ca. 80\% of the seeds experimentally placed on the ground below trees. Half-lives of seeds (a measure of seed-removal rates) placed below productive pifion pines was 6.6 h in autumn 1993 and 18.6 h in autumn 1994. When 200 radioactively labeled seeds were placed under each of five "source trees," rodents quickly removed many and cached most of the seeds they removed. At two of the source trees, rodents stored nearly all seeds in their burrow larders. At the other three source trees, rodents scatter hoarded many of the seeds, with most seeds buried 3-29 mm deep. Dispersal distances of scatter-hoarded seeds ranged up to 38.6 m, and 36\% of the caches were found under shrubs. During summer 1995, 69\% of established seedlings occurred under shrubs, which served nurse plants for young pines. Although pifion pines appear to be coevolved or coadapted with corvid (jay and nutcracker) seed dispersers, rodents also serve as important agents of seed dispersal.},

The main difference between the two transects is the steeper elevational gradient for mean annual and summer precipitation in the southern transect. For any given species, we found that isotopic differences between individual plants growing at the same site commonly equal differences measured for plants along the entire altitudinal gradient. In C3 plants, {$\delta$}13Cleaf values become slightly enriched at the lowest elevations, the opposite of trends identified in more humid regions. Apparently, increasing water-use efficiency with drought stress offsets the influence of other biotic and abiotic factors that operate to decrease isotopic discrimination with elevation. For some species shared by the two transects (e.g., Pinus edulis and Cercocarpus montanus), {$\delta$}13Cleaf values are dramatically depleted at sites that receive more than 550 mm mean annual precipitation, roughly the boundary (pedalferpedocal) at which soils commonly fill to field capacity in summer and carbonates are leached. We hypothesize that, in summer-wet areas, this may represent the boundary at which drought stress overtakes other factors in determining the sign of {$\delta$}13Cleaf with elevation. The opposition of isotopic trends with elevation in arid versus humid regions cautions against standard correction for elevation in comparative studies of {$\delta$}13Cleaf.},

We analyzed 125 time series of grazing mammal translocations in South African protected areas. Some 94\% of translocations succeeded (66\% unambiguously) even though most populations began with {$<$}15 individuals and most of the species involved are of conservation concern. Adding new individuals to existing small populations increases per capita growth rates and seems to prevent translocations from failing. Growth of the translocated populations is both greater and less variable than wild mammal populations and appears less affected by the typically important ecological factors (e.g., initial propagule size, precipitation, reserve size, or presence within historical range). One-third of the populations showed robust signs of density dependence but we detect few examples of Allee effects. Our results, from empirical time series of small populations, offer new insights into achieving success for translocation programs limited to releasing few individuals.},

Our analyses of longitudinal data from unmanaged old forests in the western United States showed that background (noncatastrophic) mortality rates have increased rapidly in recent decades, with doubling periods ranging from 17 to 29 years among regions. Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees. Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the increases in tree mortality rates.},

As climate change trends are now emerging from the natural variability, we can apply this concept to climate predictions and compute the reliability of simulated local and regional temperature and precipitation trends (1950\textendash{}2011) in a recent multi-model ensemble of climate model simulations prepared for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report (AR5).With only a single verification time, the verification is over the spatial dimension. The local temperature trends appear to be reliable. However, when the global mean climate response is factored out, the ensemble is overconfident: the observed trend is outside the range of modelled trends in many more regions than would be expected by the model estimate of natural variability and model spread. Precipitation trends are overconfident for all trend definitions. This implies that for near-term local climate forecasts the CMIP5 ensemble cannot simply be used as a reliable probabilistic forecast. Keywords:},

In order to gain a better understanding of its ecology, and therefore also its protection, a transplantation experiment in seven natural sites (forest and field) and one in a garden, involving bulbs and seeds, was carried out between 1985 and 1990. The objectives were to determine (1) which environmental factors (light availability, soil moisture and soil nutrient levels) most strongly affect the survival and growth of A. tricoccum and (2) which developmental stages are most susceptible to the adverse effects of the environmental factors studied. Separate redundancy analyses were performed on demographic parameters (such as growth and mortality rates) of both juvenile and adult transplants to determine the importance of each environmental factor. Transplants, except for seedlings, showed low initial mortality rates. Transplantation shock appeared to be minimal Seedling emergence rate was site-specific and was mostly influenced by soil moisture. Summer drought prolonged seed dormancy. Redundancy analyses showed that soil moisture was the most important environmental factor affecting survival and growth of the transplants, whereas light availability did not significantly affect survival and growth. High soil nutrient levels appeared to help maintain growth of both juveniles and adult transplants. These results showed that A. tricoccum may be flexible enough to grow under various environmental conditions, not necessarily just under forest canopies. A. tricoccum could be grown in open agricultural fields due to its tolerance to full sunlight as long as abundant soil moisture is available.},

Understanding the relative importance of environmental factors and historical processes in determining species' geographic ranges is crucial for predicting the impacts of climate change. Here, we experimentally assessed the survival and performance of four understorey forest plants (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum, Scilla bifolia, Iris foetidissima and Symphytum tuberosum) transplanted beyond their natural range limit over a 7-year period. Since the survival probability of plants transplanted beyond their natural geographic range is expected to decrease with the home-away distance, the species represent a gradient in the distance between the transplant site and their natural geographic range limit (from 50 to 500. km). Three of the four species still survived seven years after introduction. Appreciable survival outside their natural geographic range partly suggests that the ranges of these plant species may be controlled by dispersal limitation. Importantly, an interspecific trend towards decreasing survival with increasing distance from the range limit was apparent. Initial competition from other understorey plants generally limited the survival and performance of the transplanted species. In conclusion, the good survival and performance of the most 'nearby' species emphasizes the importance of dispersal limitation in determining range limits, while the poor survival of the 'farther' species suggests that their occurrence is (co-)controlled by environmental factors such as the local climate. Finally, we briefly discuss our results within the context of human-mediated assisted migration in the face of climate change. \textcopyright{} 2011 Gesellschaft f{\"u}r {\"o}kologie.},

Our results show spatial differences in trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between 1984 and 2006, which were highly related to the spatial distribution of aridity. There was a strong correlation between the change in the NDVI values and the climatic water balance in each forest (R = 0.86, p = 0.006). A large increment of the NDVI was observed in forests located in the most humid areas, whereas those located in the most arid areas showed a slight decrease in the NDVI. We used a forest growth simulation model (GOTILWA+) to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) in each of the eight analyzed forests, and found similar results to those obtained for the NDVI. Significant correlation was found between the spatial pattern of NDVI and LAI trends between 1984 and 2006 (R = 0.82, p = 0.01). The climate evolution in the last four decades explains the observed and modeled changes in the NDVI and the LAI. In agreement with other studies, we showed that the general response of the forests to more favorable conditions (in terms of temperature increment and CO2fertilization) is increased leaf activity and biomass. Nevertheless, in forests located in the most arid areas the positive trend observed in the potential evapotranspiration rates increased water stress, and had a negative effect on forest growth. Given the future predictions of warming and declining precipitation from global climate models for the Mediterranean region, an increase in stress conditions affecting these forests is expected, which will affect their growth and survival, mainly in the most arid areas. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We evaluated the response of the Earth land biomes to drought by correlating a drought index with three global indicators of vegetation activity and growth: vegetation indices from satellite imagery, tree-ring growth series, and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) records. Arid and humid biomes are both affected by drought, and we suggest that the persistence of the water deficit (i.e., the drought time-scale) could be playing a key role in determining the sensitivity of land biomes to drought. We found that arid biomes respond to drought at short time-scales; that is, there is a rapid vegetation reaction as soon as water deficits below normal conditions occur. This may be due to the fact that plant species of arid regions have mechanisms allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. Humid biomes also respond to drought at short time-scales, but in this case the physiological mechanisms likely differ from those operating in arid biomes, as plants usually have a poor adaptability to water shortage. On the contrary, semiarid and subhumid biomes respond to drought at long time-scales, probably because plants are able to withstand water deficits, but they lack the rapid response of arid biomes to drought. These results are consistent among three vegetation parameters analyzed and across different land biomes, showing that the response of vegetation to drought depends on characteristic drought time-scales for each biome. Understanding the dominant time-scales at which drought most influences vegetation might help assessing the resistance and resilience of vegetation and improving our knowledge of vegetation vulnerability to climate change.},

However, conflicts between observations and predictions are increasingly accumulating and little progress has been made in explaining this disparity. We argue that a revision of the concept of marginality is necessary, together with explicit testing of population decline, which is increasingly possible as data availability improves. Such action should be based on taking the population perspective across a species' rear edge, encompassing the ecological, geographical and genetic dimensions of marginality. Refining our understanding of rear edge populations is essential to advance our ability to monitor, predict and plan for the impacts of environmental change on species range dynamics.},

Almost no Austrocedrus establishment has occurred since the warm-dry period began in c. 1980, In contrast, many trees established during the cool-wet conditions between 1963 and 1979 with peaks in numbers of surviving trees corresponding to particularly cool-wet conditions in 1964-66 and 1973-75.3 Throughout the twentieth century, relatively few Austrocedrus survive from periods of extreme and persistent ({$>$} 5 years) drought. In contrast, short droughts (1-2 years) are not reflected in age structure patterns, Periods of reduced radial growth reflect spring-summer moisture deficits and coincide with approximately decade-long periods of fewer surviving trees.4 Prior to c. 1900, relationships of age structure to variation in radial growth are less clear due to the confounding influences of increasingly inaccurate age determinations of older trees, and the cumulative effects of past changes in disturbance regimes,5 Variations in both climate and disturbance regimes influence the regional pattern of age structures of Austrocedrus. For example, near the ecotone the frequency of surface fires has declined drastically during the present century as has the severity of browsing by livestock during the past approximate to 40 years, The reduction in these disturbances was probably a necessary condition for the increase in Austrocedrus establishment during the 1963-79 cool-wet interval.},

Morphological differentiation between habitats (QHT) in elongation traits was greater than marker divergence (FHT), suggesting adaptive differentiation. Genotypes from open- and closed-canopy habitats differed in shade avoidance traits in several population pairs, whereas patterns of AFLP differentiation suggest this differentiation does not have a single origin. These results suggest that open- and closed-canopy habitats present different selective pressures, but that the outcome of diversifying selection may differ depending on specific closed- and open-canopy habitats and on starting genetic variation. Hierarchical partitioning of FST and QST makes it possible to distinguish global stabilizing selection on traits across a landscape from diversifying selection between habitat types within regions.},

Thus, variation in the shape of display schedules can affect the degree of population synchrony and the strength of phenological assortative mating by flowering onset date. A good understanding of the mechanisms regulating the timing of flowering onset has been developed, but we know less about factors influencing subsequent patterns of floral display. * We observed unusual multimodal display schedules in temperate populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata. Here, we ask whether `flowering pulses' are simultaneous among individuals and populations and explore potential underlying mechanisms and consequences of pulsed flowering. * We monitored daily flower production for individual plants from genetically divergent populations during a series of field experiments that manipulated three potential influencers of display schedule shape: average daily temperature, pollinator availability and watering schedules. We measured floral longevity to isolate the contributions of flower retention and flower deployment to display schedules. We assessed relationships between flowering and environmental variables and compared estimates of population synchrony, individual synchrony and the strength of assortative mating with those of 29 unimodally flowering species from the area. * We observed simultaneous flowering pulses in all experiments, with peaks aligned among individuals and populations despite variation in flowering onset and/or duration. Pulses were not the result of increases in average temperature, pollinator availability or variation in watering schedules. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature correlated with floral longevity and flower deployment, suggesting that the shape of display schedules may be plastic in response to fluctuations in temperature. Average population and individual synchrony differed only slightly from those of the species with unimodal schedules, while the average strength of assortative mating for flowering onset date was strongly reduced (0.21 in C. fasciculata vs. 0.35 for the 29 other species). * Synthesis. Researchers should take caution in assuming that components of display schedules are genetically or developmentally correlated with flowering onset. Variation in the shape of display schedules can influence patterns of gene flow within or between populations, with potential effects on the strength of phenological assortative mating and subsequent responses to selection.},

  abstract = {Global warming will jeopardize the persistence and genetic diversity of many species. Assisted colonization, or the movement of species beyond their current range boundary, is a conservation strategy proposed for species with limited dispersal abilities or adaptive potential. However, species that rely on photoperiodic and thermal cues for development may experience conflicting signals if transported across latitudes. Relocating multiple, distinct populations may remedy this quandary by expanding genetic variation and promoting evolutionary responses in the receiving habitat - a strategy known as assisted gene flow. To better inform these policies, we planted seeds from latitudinally distinct populations of the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, in a potential future colonization site north of its current range boundary. Plants were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures via infrared heating. We monitored several life history traits and estimated patterns of natural selection to determine the adaptive value of plastic responses. To assess the feasibility of assisted gene flow between phenologically distinct populations, we counted flowers each day and estimated the degree of temporal isolation between populations. Increased temperatures advanced each successive phenological trait more than the last, resulting in a compressed life cycle for all but the southern-most population. Warming altered patterns of selection on flowering onset and vegetative biomass. Population performance was dependent on latitude of origin, with the northern-most population performing best under ambient conditions and the southern-most performing most poorly, even under elevated temperatures. Among-population differences in flowering phenology limited the potential for genetic exchange among the northern- and southern-most populations. All plastic responses to warming were neutral or adaptive; however, photoperiodic constraints will likely necessitate evolutionary responses for long-term persistence, especially when involving populations from disparate latitudes. With strategic planning, our results suggest that assisted colonization and assisted gene flow may be feasible options for preservation.},

We integrate data from a 43 yr record of first flowering for six species in subalpine Colorado meadows with a 3 yr snow manipulation experiment on the perennial forb Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae) from the same site. We analyze shifts in the onset of flowering in relation to environmental drivers known to influence phenology: the timing of snowmelt, the accumulation of growing degree days, and photoperiod. Variation in responses to climate change depended on the sequence in which species flowered, with early-flowering species reproducing faster, at a lower heat sum, and under increasingly disparate photoperiods relative to later-flowering species. Early snow-removal treatments confirm that the timing of snowmelt governs observed trends in flowering phenology of B. stricta and that climate change can reduce the probability of flowering, thereby depressing fitness. Our findings suggest that climate change is decoupling historical combinations of photoperiod and temperature and outpacing phenological changes for our focal species. Accurate predictions of biological responses to climate change require a thorough understanding of the factors driving shifts in phenology.},

  abstract = {Understanding how landscape heterogeneity constrains gene flow and the spread of adaptive genetic variation is important for biological conservation given current global change. However, the integration of population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics remains an interdisciplinary challenge at the levels of concepts and methods. We present a conceptual framework to relate the spatial distribution of genetic variation to the processes of gene flow and adaptation as regulated by spatial heterogeneity of the environment, while explicitly considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of landscapes, organisms and their genes. When selecting the appropriate analytical methods, it is necessary to consider the effects of multiple processes and the nature of population genetic data. Our framework relates key landscape genetics questions to four levels of analysis: (i) node-based methods, which model the spatial distribution of alleles at sampling locations (nodes) from local site characteristics; these methods are suitable for modeling adaptive genetic variation while accounting for the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (ii) Link-based methods, which model the probability of gene flow between two patches (link) and relate neutral molecular marker data to landscape heterogeneity; these methods are suitable for modeling neutral genetic variation but are subject to inferential problems, which may be alleviated by reducing links based on a network model of the population. (iii) Neighborhood-based methods, which model the connectivity of a focal patch with all other patches in its local neighborhood; these methods provide a link to metapopulation theory and landscape connectivity modeling and may allow the integration of node- and link-based information, but applications in landscape genetics are still limited. (iv) Boundary-based methods, which delineate genetically homogeneous populations and infer the location of genetic boundaries; these methods are suitable for testing for barrier effects of landscape features in a hypothesis-testing framework. We conclude that the power to detect the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of genetic variation can be increased by explicit consideration of underlying assumptions and choice of an appropriate analytical approach depending on the research question.},

To put these ideas into practice, an advisor and a student need to communicate effectively. Here, we focus on the dynamics of day-to-day interactions and discuss (1) how to provide feedback that builds students' competence and confidence, (2) how to choose the way we communicate and avoid a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal communication, and (3) how to prevent and resolve conflict. Miscommunication may happen out of a lack of understanding of the psychological aspects of human interactions. Therefore, we draw on concepts from Educational Transactional Analysis to provide advisors and students with an understanding of the psychological aspects of graduate advising as a basis for effective communication. Case studies illustrate the relevance of the concepts presented, and four worksheets (Supplementary Material) support their practical implementation.},

  abstract = {Species patchiness implies that nearby observations of species abundance tend to be similar or that individual conspecific organisms are more closely spaced than by random chance. This can be caused either by the positive spatial autocorrelation among the locations of individual organisms due to ecological spatial processes (e.g., species dispersal, competition for space and resources) or by spatial dependence due to (positive or negative) species responses to underlying environmental conditions. Both forms of spatial structure pose problems for statistical analysis, as spatial autocorrelation in the residuals violates the assumption of independent observations, while environmental heterogeneity restricts the comparability of replicates. In this paper, we discuss how spatial structure due to ecological spatial processes and spatial dependence affects spatial statistics, landscape metrics, and statistical modeling of the species\textendash{}environment correlation. For instance, while spatial statistics can quantify spatial pattern due to an endogeneous spatial process, these methods are severely affected by landscape environmental heterogeneity. Therefore, statistical models of species response to the environment not only need to accommodate spatial structure, but need to distinguish between components due to exogeneous and endogeneous processes rather than discarding all spatial variance. To discriminate between different components of spatial structure, we suggest using (multivariate) spatial analysis of residuals or delineating the spatial realms of a stationary spatial process using boundary detection algorithms. We end by identifying conceptual and statistical challenges that need to be addressed for adequate spatial analysis of landscapes.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary lineages differ greatly in their net diversification rates, implying differences in rates of extinction and speciation. Lineages with a large average range size are commonly thought to have reduced extinction risk (although linking low extinction to high diversification has proved elusive). However, climate change cycles can dramatically reduce the geographic range size of even widespread species, and so most species may be periodically reduced to a few populations in small, isolated remnants of their range. This implies a high and synchronous extinction risk for the remaining populations, and so for the species as a whole. Species will only survive through these periods if their individual populations are "threat tolerant," somehow able to persist in spite of the high extinction risk. Threat tolerance is conceptually different from classic extinction resistance, and could theoretically have a stronger relationship with diversification rates than classic resistance. I demonstrate that relationship using primates as a model. I also show that narrowly distributed species have higher threat tolerance than widespread ones, confirming that tolerance is an unusual form of resistance. Extinction resistance may therefore operate by different rules during periods of adverse global environmental change than in more benign periods.},

  abstract = {Global climate change (GCC) increasingly threatens biodiversity through the loss of species, and the transformation of entire ecosystems. Many species are challenged by the pace of GCC because they might not be able to respond fast enough to changing biotic and abiotic conditions. Species can respond either by shifting their range, or by persisting in their local habitat. If populations persist, they can tolerate climatic changes through phenotypic plasticity, or genetically adapt to changing conditions depending on their genetic variability and census population size to allow for de novo mutations. Otherwise, populations will experience demographic collapses and species may go extinct. Current approaches to predicting species responses to GCC begin to combine ecological and evolutionary information for species distribution modelling. Including an evolutionary dimension will substantially improve species distribution projections which have not accounted for key processes such as dispersal, adaptive genetic change, demography, or species interactions. However, eco-evolutionary models require new data and methods for the estimation of a species' adaptive potential, which have so far only been available for a small number of model species. To represent global biodiversity, we need to devise large-scale data collection strategies to define the ecology and evolutionary potential of a broad range of species, especially of keystone species of ecosystems. We also need standardized and replicable modelling approaches that integrate these new data to account for eco-evolutionary processes when predicting the impact of GCC on species' survival. Here, we discuss different genomic approaches that can be used to investigate and predict species responses to GCC. This can serve as guidance for researchers looking for the appropriate experimental setup for their particular system. We furthermore highlight future directions for moving forward in the field and allocating available resources more effectively, to implement mitigation measures before species go extinct and ecosystems lose important functions.},

Here, we develop a spatially explicit simulation model to quantify the contribution of existing genetic variation arising from migration\textendash{}mutation\textendash{}selection\textendash{}drift balance to time to extinction under environmental change. Simulations reveal that local adaptation across a species range associated with an underlying environmental gradient could extend time to extinction by nearly threefold irrespective of the rate of environmental change. The potential for preadapted alleles to increase the rate of adaptation changes the relative importance of established extinction risk factors; in particular, it reduced the importance of the breadth of environmental tolerance and it increased the relative importance of fecundity. Although migration of preadapted alleles generally increased persistence time, it decreased it at rates of environmental change close to the critical rate of change by creating a population bottleneck, which ultimately limited the rate at which de novo mutations could arise. An analysis of the extinction dynamics further revealed that one consequence of gene flow is the potential to maximize population growth rate in at least part of the species range, which is likely to have consequences for forecasting the consequences of ecological interactions. Our study shows that predictions of persistence time change fundamentally when existing local adaptations are explicitly taken into account, underscoring the need to preserve and manage genetic diversity.},

However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16\% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23\% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Selection for both growth and wood quality is the primary goal of many tree breeding programs. In order to investigate the impacts of such selection on adaptive traits, observations were made on phenology, drought resistance, xylem conductance and xylem vulnerability to cavitation of 2-year-old seedlings of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud var. latifolia Engelm) from four subpopulations: (1) fast height growth and high wood density (FH); (2) slow height growth and high density (SH); (3) fast height growth and low density (FL); and (4) slow height growth and low density (SL). Results showed that the impact of the selection on phenology was minor; differences in growth among subpopulations were mainly attributable to maximal growth rate and the duration of the period of rapid growth. The FL subpop- ulation showed a significantly stronger productivity decline in response to moderate drought compared to the two slower-growing subpopulations. The FH subpop- ulation showed significantly higher xylem specific con- ductivity than the two slower-growing subpopulations, and greater resistance to cavitation than the other three subpopulations, suggesting the possibility of selecting families that combine fast growth, high wood density and drought tolerance.},

  abstract = {In advanced generation seed orchards, tradeoffs exist between genetic gain obtained by selecting the best related individuals for seed orchard populations, and potential losses due to subsequent inbreeding between these individuals. Although inbreeding depression for growth rate is strong in most forest tree species at the individual tree level, the effect of a small proportion of inbreds in seed lots on final stand yield may be less important. The effects of inbreeding on wood production of mature stands cannot be assessed empirically in the short term, thus such effects were simulated for coastal Douglas fir [ Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] using an individual-tree growth and yield model TASS (Tree and Stand Simulator). The simulations were based on seed set, nursery culling rates, and 10-year-old field test performance for trees resulting from crosses between unrelated individuals and for inbred trees produced through mating between half-sibs, full-sibs, parents and offspring and self-pollination. Results indicate that inclusion of a small proportion of related clones in seed orchards will have relatively low impacts on stand yields due to low probability of related individuals mating, lower probability of producing acceptable seedlings from related matings than from unrelated matings, and a greater probability of competition-induced mortality for slower growing inbred individuals than for outcrossed trees. Thus, competition reduces the losses expected due to inbreeding depression at harvest, particularly on better sites with higher planting densities and longer rotations. Slightly higher breeding values for related clones than unrelated clones would offset or exceed the effects of inbreeding resulting from related matings. Concerns regarding the maintenance of genetic diversity are more likely to limit inclusion of related clones in orchards than inbreeding depression for final stand yield.},

Estimates of climate variables were validated using an independent dataset from weather stations that were not included in the development of the model. Weather station records generally agreed well with estimated climate variables and showed significant improvements over original PRISM climate data. A stand-alone MS Windows application was developed to perform all calculations and to integrate future climate predictions from various global circulation models. We demonstrate the use of this application by showing how climate change may affect lodgepole pine seed planning zones for reforestation in British Columbia.

Results of this study suggest that new methods for anchoring population response functions, and a multivariate approach for incorpor- ating climate variables into a single model, considerably improve the reliability of these functions. These functions identified a small number of populations in central areas of the species distribution with greater growth potential over a wide range of mean annual temperature (MAT). Average productivity of lodgepole pine is predicted to increase (up to 7\%) if moderate warming (ÓÄÅ2 1C MAT) occurs in the next few decades as predicted, although productivity would substantially decline in some SPUs in southern BC. Severe global warming (43 1C MAT) would result in either a drastic decline in productivity or local populations being extirpated in southern SPUs. New deployment strategies using the best seed sources for future reforestation may not only be able to mitigate the negative impact of global warming, but may even be able to increase productivity in some areas.},

Population response functions describe the environmental effect of planting site climates on the performance of a single population, whereas transfer functions describe among-population genetic variation molded by natural selection for climate. Although these approaches are widely used to predict the responses of trees to climate change, both have limitations. We present a novel approach that integrates both genetic and environmental effects into a single "universal response function" (URF) to better predict the influence of climate on phenotypes. Using a large lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) field transplant experiment composed of 140 populations planted on 62 sites to demonstrate the methodology, we show that the URF makes full use of data from provenance trials to: (1) improve predictions of climate change impacts on phenotypes; (2) reduce the size and cost of future provenance trials without compromising predictive power; (3) more fully exploit existing, less comprehensive provenance tests; (4) quantify and compare environmental and genetic effects of climate on population performance; and (5) predict the performance of any population growing in any climate. Finally, we discuss how the last attribute allows the URF to be used as a mechanistic model to predict population and species ranges for the future and to guide assisted migration of seed for reforestation, restoration, or afforestation and genetic conservation in a changing climate.},

Ecological and geographic variables can contribute to genetic structure through geographic isolation, in which geographic barriers and distances restrict gene flow, and ecological isolation, in which gene flow among populations inhabiting different environments is limited by selection against dispersers moving between them. Although methods have been developed to study geographic isolation in detail, ecological isolation has received much less attention, partly because disentangling the effects of these mechanisms is inherently difficult. Here, I describe a novel approach for quantifying the effects of geographic and ecological isolation using multiple matrix regression with randomization. I explored the parameter space over which this method is effective using a series of individual-based simulations and found that it accurately describes the effects of geographic and ecological isolation over a wide range of conditions. I also applied this method to a set of real-world datasets to show that ecological isolation is an often overlooked but important contributor to patterns of spatial genetic variation and to demonstrate how this analysis can provide new insights into how landscapes contribute to the evolution of genetic variation in nature.},

  abstract = {Coupled with rapid developments of efficient genetic markers, powerful population genetic methods were proposed to estimate migration rates (m) in natural populations in much broader spatial and temporal scales than the traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods. Highly polymorphic (e.g. microsatellites) and genomic-wide (e.g. SNPs) markers provide sufficient information to assign individuals to their populations or parents of origin and thereby to estimate directly m in a way similar to MRR. Such direct estimates of current migration rates are particularly useful in understanding the ecology and microevolution of wild populations and in managing the populations in the future. In this study, I proposed and implemented, in the software MigEst, a likelihood method to use marker-based parentage assignments in jointly estimating m and candidate parent sampling proportions (x) in a subset of populations, investigated its power and accuracy using data simulated in various scenarios of population properties (e.g. the actual m, number, size and differentiation of populations) and sampling properties (e.g. the numbers of sampled parent candidates, offspring and markers), compared it with the population assignment approach implemented in the software BayesAss and demonstrated its usefulness by analysing a microsatellite data set from three natural populations of Brazilian bats. Simulations showed that MigEst provides unbiased and accurate estimates of m and performs better than BayesAss except when populations are highly differentiated with very small and ecologically insignificant migration rates. A valuable property of MigEst is that in the presence of unsampled populations, it gives good estimates of the rate of migration among sampled populations as well as of the rate of migration into each sampled population from the pooled unsampled populations.},

Here, we focus on insect herbivores and link the climate change and invasive research fields. We illustrate using existing published research that life history traits can be useful indicators of future invasive potential. However, climate change will also affect propagule pressure and the communities into which invaders will arrive. With the aid of a meta-analysis we show that climate-induced community changes are likely to increase niche-availability in the future, further exacerbating the problem of invasive species.

However, a common critique of the PDSI is that the behavior of the index at various locations is inconsistent, making spatial comparisons of PDSI values difficult, if not meaningless. A self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (SC-PDSI) is presented and evaluated. The SC-PDSI automatically calibrates the behavior of the index at any location by replacing empirical constants in the index computation with dynamically calculated values. An evaluation of the SC-PDSI at 761 sites within Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, as well as at all 344 climate divisions shows that it is more spatially comparable than the PDSI, and reports extreme wet and dry conditions with frequencies that would be expected for rare conditions.},

  abstract = {How do banks operate and where does the money supply come from? The financial crisis has heightened awareness that these questions have been unduly neglected by many researchers. During the past century, three different theories of banking were dominant at different times: (1) The currently prevalent financial intermediation theory of banking says that banks collect deposits and then lend these out, just like other non-bank financial intermediaries. (2) The older fractional reserve theory of banking says that each individual bank is a financial intermediary without the power to create money, but the banking system collectively is able to create money through the process of `multiple deposit expansion' (the `money multiplier'). (3) The credit creation theory of banking, predominant a century ago, does not consider banks as financial intermediaries that gather deposits to lend out, but instead argues that each individual bank creates credit and money newly when granting a bank loan. The theories differ in their accounting treatment of bank lending as well as in their policy implications. Since according to the dominant financial intermediation theory banks are virtually identical with other non-bank financial intermediaries, they are not usually included in the economic models used in economics or by central bankers. Moreover, the theory of banks as intermediaries provides the rationale for capital adequacy-based bank regulation. Should this theory not be correct, currently prevailing economics modelling and policy-making would be without empirical foundation. Despite the importance of this question, so far only one empirical test of the three theories has been reported in learned journals. This paper presents a second empirical test, using an alternative methodology, which allows control for all other factors. The financial intermediation and the fractional reserve theories of banking are rejected by the evidence. This finding throws doubt on the rationale for regulating bank capital adequacy to avoid banking crises, as the case study of Credit Suisse during the crisis illustrates. The finding indicates that advice to encourage developing countries to borrow from abroad is misguided. The question is considered why the economics profession has failed over most of the past century to make any progress concerning knowledge of the monetary system, and why it instead moved ever further away from the truth as already recognised by the credit creation theory well over a century ago. The role of conflicts of interest and interested parties in shaping the current bank-free academic consensus is discussed. A number of avenues for needed further research are indicated.},

The most useful QTL for breeding applications are those that have been verified in time, space, and/or genetic background. In this study, spring cold-hardiness of Douglas-fir foliar tissues was evaluated in two clonally replicated (n=170 and 383 clones) full-sib cohorts derived from the same parental cross in two different years (made 5 years apart). The cohorts were established in widely separated forest test sites and tissues were artificially freeze tested using different cold injury assessment methods. Four of six unique QTL detected for spring cold-hardiness in needles of Cohort 1 were tentatively verified in the second cohort. Four additional QTL were detected in Cohort 2, two on linkage groups (LGs) not previously represented in the smaller cohort. In total, 10 unique QTL were identified across both cohorts. Seventeen of twenty-nine putative cold-hardiness candidate genes (Douglas-fir ESTs) placed on the Douglas-fir linkage map locate within the 95\% confidence intervals of spring needle cold-hardiness QTL from the two cohorts and thus represent priority targets for initiating association mapping in Douglas-fir. \textcopyright{} 2005 Springer.},

  abstract = {Habitat destruction and the resultant fragmentation of the remaining forest are a common phenomenon in the tropics. Most investigations emphasize the potential dangers of fragmentation in isolating patches of forest and exposing populations to loss of species diversity through founder effects, genetic drift, inbreeding, and restricted gene flow. However, a limited number of studies have shown that gene flow may be extensive in tropical trees, suggesting that it may occur between forest fragments and also "isolated" remnant trees. There is an urgent need to quantify pollen flow within and between forest fragments to test the veracity of such views and determine the genetic value of such fragments for in situ conservation. Microsatellite markers are used to genotype individuals of Swietenia humilis from a highly fragmented forest mosaic to directly quantify pollen-mediated gene flow. Distances of pollen flow more than 10 times greater than previously reported were detected. Our results show that some tropical angiosperm tree species may be much more adaptable and resilient to habitat destruction and fragmentation than previously considered. The description of many remnant trees as isolated or "living dead" may be more a conditioning of human perception than a true reflection of their potential conservation value.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that the heritable genetic variation within individual species, especially dominant and keystone species, has community and ecosystem consequences. These consequences represent extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects. (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype \dbend{} environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in demonstrating community evolution. (5) Community genetics requires and promotes an integrative approach, from genes to ecosystems, that is necessary for the marriage of ecology and genetics. Few studies span from genes to ecosystems, but such integration is probably essential for understanding the natural world.},

These measures are variants of FST, a standardized measure of the genetic variance among populations, and are used to solve for Nm, the number of migrants successfully entering a population per generation. Unfortunately, the mathematical model underlying this translation makes many biologically unrealistic assumptions; real populations are very likely to violate these assumptions, such that there is often limited quantitative information to be gained about dispersal from using gene frequency data. While studies of genetic structure per se are often worthwhile, and FST is an excellent measure of the extent of this population structure, it is rare that FST can be translated into an accurate estimate of Nm.},

  abstract = {Abstract We build on previous observations that Hill?Robertson interference generates an advantage of sex that, in structured populations, can be large enough to explain the evolutionary maintenance of costly sex. We employed a gene network model that explicitly incorporates interactions between genes. Mutations in the gene networks have variable effects that depend on the genetic background in which they appear. Consequently, our simulations include two costs of sex?recombination and migration loads?that were missing from previous studies of the evolution of costly sex. Our results suggest a critical role for population structure that lies in its ability to align the long- and short-term advantages of sex. We show that the addition of population structure favored the evolution of sex by disproportionately decreasing the equilibrium mean fitness of asexual populations, primarily by increasing the strength of Muller's Ratchet. Population structure also increased the ability of the short-term advantage of sex to counter the primary limit to the evolution of sex in the gene network model?recombination load. On the other hand, highly structured populations experienced migration load in the form of Dobzhansky?Muller incompatibilities, decreasing the effective rate of migration between demes and, consequently, accelerating the accumulation of drift load in the sexual populations.},

  abstract = {The role of hybridization in adaptive evolution is contentious. While many cases of adaptive trait introgression have been proposed, the relevant traits have rarely been identified, resulting in a lack of clear examples of this process. Here, we examine a purported case of adaptive introgression in which the annual sunflower Helianthus annuus annuus has captured alleles from a congener (Helianthus debilis) to form a stabilized hybrid, Helianthus annuus texanus. We tested the hypotheses that herbivore resistance traits have introgressed from H. debilis to H. annuus and have increased adaptation in the latter. In two common gardens, fitness (estimated by seed production) was on average 55\% higher in H. a. texanus than in H. a. annuus. For H. a. texanus, three damage traits (of seven tested) differed significantly from the H. a. annuus parent in one or both sites and were shifted in the direction of the more resistant H. debilis. Natural selection favored H. a. annuus \# H. debilis BC1 hybrids (synthesized to mimic the ancestors of H. a. texanus) with H. debilis\textendash{}like resistance to seed midges Neolasioptera helianthis and to receptacle/seed feeding Lepidoptera at one or both sites. Assuming similar herbivore pressures in the past, these results suggest that introgression of biotic resistance traits was important in the adaptation of H. annuus to central and southern Texas.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.The ability of a population to genetically adapt to a changing environment is contingent not only on the level of existing genetic variation within that population, but also on the gene flow received from differently adapted populations. Effective pollen-mediated gene flow among plant populations requires synchrony of flowering. Therefore differences in timing of flowering among genetically divergent populations may reduce their ability to adapt to environmental change. To determine whether gene flow among differently adapted populations of native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Scotland was restricted by differences in their flowering phenology, we measured timing of pollen release among populations spanning a steep environmental gradient over three consecutive seasons (2014-2016). Results showed that, over a distance of 137 km, there were as many as 15.8 days' difference among populations for the predicted timing of peak pollen shedding, with the earliest development in the warmer west of the country. There was much variation between years, with the earliest development and least synchrony in the warmest year (2014) and latest development and greatest synchrony in the coolest year (2015). Timing was negatively correlated with results from a common-garden experiment, indicative of a pattern of countergradient variation. We conclude that the observed differences in reproductive synchrony were sufficient to limit gene flow via pollen between populations of P. sylvestris at opposite ends of the environmental gradient across Scotland. We also hypothesize that continually warming, or asymmetrically warming spring temperatures will decrease reproductive synchrony among pine populations.},

  abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species).

Outcrossing in conifers is promoted via an embryo-lethal system, but the genetic mechanism is poorly understood. This study is the first experimental profile of the genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing in conifers. Molecular dissection of a Pinus taeda L. selfed pedigree detected a chromosomal region identified as PtTX3020-RPtest9. Within this region, a semilethal factor was tightly linked (r = 0.0076) to a polymorphic expressed sequence tag (EST). The linkage group flanking the lethal factor showed strong heterozygote advantage. Using genotypic frequencies for the linkage group, three hypotheses about the semilethal factor could be tested: (1) the presence of a balanced lethal system, i.e., a lethal factor present in each of the two marker intervals; (2) gametic selection operative prior to fertilization; and (3) a stage-specific lethal factor. Selection acted via the embryo-lethal system. No support for a genetic mechanism operating prior to fertilization was found. The semilethal factor exerted no effect after embryo maturity. The genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing in P. taeda L. appears to have a balancing selection system due to either pseudo-overdominance or true overdominance.},

With added age and size, greater quantities of seed and pollen travel even farther via long-distance dispersal. Perennial reproduction in conifers means that the same plant disperses annually for one or more decades prior to harvest. Although complex, gene flow in transgenic trees will have adverse consequences only if the following conditions are met: (1) the inserted gene or DNA construct itself inflicts harm or (2) the DNA insertion event causes unintended or secondary effects on fitness traits. Here, transgene seed escape into less managed ecosystems was modeled across 5 and 50 generations using Pinus taeda, an indigenous US timber commodity species. The inserted DNA construct itself was assumed to exert no direct effects on fitness but rather caused secondary or unintended effects on one or more fitness traits. The deterministic population genetics model, based on one or two fitness components, predicted the transgene allele frequency for a single colony of escaped transgenic seedlings through time. The first scenario modeled commercial transgenic plantations. A transgene allele escaping from a 100-ha plantation spread rapidly through time even if it exerted slight, unintended secondary effects on viability and fecundity. The second scenario modeled the case of a 10-ha field trial surrounded by non-transgenic or wild-type forests. Here, transgene spread was slowed by dilution from non-transgenic sources. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Key risks associated with projected climate trends for the 21st century include the prospects of future climate states with no current analog and the disappearance of some extant climates. Because climate is a primary control on species distributions and ecosystem processes, novel 21st-century climates may promote formation of novel species associations and other ecological surprises, whereas the disappearance of some extant climates increases risk of extinction for species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities. Here we analyze multimodel ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience (i) high magnitudes of local climate change, (ii) development of novel 21st-century climates, and/or (iii) the disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical montane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39\% and 10-48\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20\% and 4-20\%. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates. There is a close correspondence between regions with globally disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots; for these regions, standard conservation solutions (e.g., assisted migration and networked reserves) may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity.},

Addressing this landscape-scale inquiry is feasible when the pollen source, the delivery system, and the receiver field can be made explicit. To this end, I measured long-distance pollen germination along a 160-km transect along the North Carolina coastline, including 45000 ha of mature Pinus taeda plantations and barrier islands. Using this system, I tested three hypotheses: (1) pine pollen germinates after dispersal on meso-scale distances, (2) sodium chloride exposure reduces germination of pollen captured over open saltwater, and (3) viable pine pollen is present at high altitudes before local peak pollen shed. The experimental findings are as follows: pine pollen had germination rates of 2 to 57\% after dispersal at distances from 3 to 41 km, sodium chloride solutions mildly reduced P. taeda pollen germination, and viable pine pollen grains were captured at an altitude of 610 m. GM pine plantings thus have a potential to disperse viable pollen at least 41 km from the source. Wind and rainfall, as integral parts of regional atmospheric systems, together exert a powerful influence on the genetic structure of forest tree populations.},

  abstract = {1. Abrupt changes and regime shifts are common phenomena in terrestrial ecological records spanning centuries to millennia, thus offering a rich opportunity to study the patterns and drivers of abrupt ecological change. 2. Because Quaternary climate changes also often were abrupt, a critical research question is to distinguish between extrinsic versus intrinsic abrupt ecological changes, i.e. those externally driven by abruptly changing climates, versus those resulting from thresholds, tipping points, and other nonlinear responses of ecological systems to progressive climate change. Extrinsic and intrinsic abrupt ecological changes can be distinguished in part by compiling and analysing regional networks of palaeoecological records. 3. Abrupt ecological changes driven by spatially coherent and abrupt climate changes should manifest as approximately synchronous ecological responses, both among different taxa at a site and among sites. However, the magnitude and direction of response may vary among sites and taxa. Ecological responses to the rapid climatic changes accompanying the last deglaciation offer good model systems for studying extrinsic abrupt change. 4. When abrupt ecological changes are intrinsically driven, the timing and rate of ecological response to climate change will be strongly governed by local biotic and abiotic processes and by stochastic processes such as disturbance events or localized climatic extremes. Consequently, at a regional scale, one should observe `temporal mosaics' of abrupt ecological change, in which the timing and rate of ecological change will vary among species within sites and among sites. These temporal mosaics are analogous to the spatial mosaics observed in ecological systems prone to threshold switches between alternate stable states. The early Holocene aridification of the North American mid-continent and the middle-Holocene aridification of North Africa may be good examples of temporal mosaics. 5. Synthesis. Past instances of extrinsic and intrinsic abrupt change are of direct relevance to global-change ecologists. The former allow study of the capacity of ecological systems to quickly adjust to abrupt climate changes, while the latter offer opportunities to understand the ecological processes causing abrupt local responses to regional climate change, to test tools for predicting critical thresholds, and to develop climate-adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Premise of the Study: Pine pollen (Pinus spp.), along with other atmospheric particles, is dispersed by the water cycle, but this mode of dispersal requires cloud-pollen interactions that depend on taxon-specific biological properties. In the simplest form of this dispersal, pine pollen ascends vertically to altitudes of 2 to 6 km, where a fraction is captured by mixed-phase cloud formation. Captured pollen accretes into frozen droplets, which ultimately descend as rain, snow, or hail. Whether Pinus pollen can still germinate after its exposure to high-altitude freezing is pertinent to (1) how forests adapt to climate change and (2) potential gene flow between genetically modified plantation species and their conspecific relatives. Methods: To address this question, pollen from four Old World and two New World Pinus species were subjected to immersion freezing, a common cloud formation mode, under laboratory conditions. Key Results: Some pollen grains immersed at -20 \textdegree{} C for 15, 60, or 120 min in either a dehydrated or a water-saturated state were still capable of germination. After exposure, dehydrated pine pollen had higher germination (43.3\%) than water-saturated pollen (7.6\%). Conclusions: Pine pollen exposed to freezing during cloud formation can still germinate, raising the question of whether rain-delivered live pollen might be linked to rain-facilitated pollination. Dispersal of live pine pollen via cloud formation and the water cycle itself deserves closer study. \textcopyright{} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

Here, we assess how well energy and water can predict long-term variations in plant richness using a 320 000-year fossil pollen data set from Hungary. Results demonstrate that a combined water\textendash{}energy model best explains the variation in plant diversity through time. However, this long temporal record also demonstrates that amplitude of energy variation appears to be a strong determinant of richness. Decreased richness correlates with increased climate variability and certain species appear to be more susceptible according to their ecological traits. These findings have important implications for predicting richness at times of increasing climate variability.},

We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

Data on shifting phenologies with warming have accumulated rapidly, yet research has been comparatively slow to explain the diversity of phenological responses observed across latitudes, growing seasons and species. Here, we outline recent efforts to synthesize perspectives on plant phenology across the fields of ecology, climate science and evolution. We highlight three major axes that vary among these disciplines: relative focus on abiotic versus biotic drivers of phenology, on plastic versus genetic drivers of intraspecific variation, and on cross-species versus autecological approaches. Recent interdisciplinary efforts, building on data covering diverse species and climate space, have found a greater role of temperature in controlling phenology at higher latitudes and for early-flowering species in temperate systems. These efforts have also made progress in understanding the tremendous diversity of responses across species by incorporating evolutionary relatedness, and linking phenological flexibility to invasions and plant performance. Future research with a focus on data collection in areas outside the temperate mid-latitudes and across species' ranges, alongside better integration of how risk and investment shape plant phenology, offers promise for further progress.},

This document aims to provide a comprehensive review of the scientific literature about the historical dynamics of natural disturbances\textemdash{}such as wildfires, windthrow, or insect and disease outbreaks\textemdash{} in forests in British Columbia. Our discussion of the literature focuses on characterizing disturbance frequency and patch size. We summarize information about important disturbance agents by biogeoclimatic zone, and by subzone and variant where applicable. Where possible, we point out the assumptions or limitations behind such information. We reviewed material from 257 sources, including peer-reviewed journal articles, theses, and published and unpublished reports. We focused on research conducted in British Columbia, but occasionally we cite research about similar ecosystems in the United States and Alberta because British Columbia-based research remains limited for several biogeoclimatic zones. Our synthesis shows that natural disturbance regimes in British Columbia are more complex than the broad natural disturbance types typically used in the province to set objectives for maintaining biodiversity (e.g., allocating old-growth reserves or maintaining certain patch-size distributions). These natural disturbance types were based primarily on the frequency of stand-replacing disturbances. Historically, disturbance severity was also key in creating certain disturbance patterns on the landscape. Many biogeoclimatic subzones were influenced by a mixed-severity regime characterized by various combinations of disturbances of different severity, or by gap-causing disturbances occurring during the long interval between stand-replacing disturbances. Our review provides a starting point for people interested in: 1) designing strategic and operational plans based on natural disturbance patterns in a specific area, 2) revising and refining the natural disturbance type classification, and 3) identifying areas for future},

Unlike selfing, low level inbreeding can produce relatively large number of viable seeds. Following previous study on the effects of inbreeding on coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) filled seed production, the present study investigated inbreeding on nursery performance over various cross- types, including outcrosses (inbreeding coefficient F=0), crosses between half-sibs (F=0.125), between full-sibs (F=0.25), between parents and offspring (F=0.25), and selfing (F=0.5). Significant differences were found among cross-types for germination, seedling mortality, seedling diameter and height, and nursery cull rate. Inbreeding also increased among-family genetic variability. Cumulative losses of seedlings at the nursery stage were 18, 33, 31, 36 and 43\%, respectively for the above types of crosses. This result indicates that seeds with low levels of inbreeding may produce relatively large numbers of seedlings that meet nursery culling standards and could be used for reforestation, resulting in negative impacts on the genetic gain realized in field plantations.\textbackslash{}n Key words: inbreeding depression, nursery performance, cull rate, genetic variability},

Those findings often rely on questionable biological conditions, and more fundamentally, the continuous nature of time in such models does not reflect the reality of the observed interaction. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-time spatial model of the interaction. The final state of our model is often a striking spatial pattern, similar to those observed. We analyze the model, describe its transient behavior, and find the conditions under which these spatial patterns occur, as well as an estimate of maximum possible patch size under those conditions.

  abstract = {Adaptive optimality of local populations is central to evolutionary biology. It also provides a genetic framework for planning gene conservation. We examined local optimality using 20-year height growth as an indicator of population fitness. The height growth data were obtained from a network of 57 long-term field trials in interior British Columbia involving a range-wide samples of 142 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Doug) populations. Local optimality was defined statistically and tested, and its geographic patterns were examined in both multi-dimensional mode and component dimensions along latitude, longitude and elevation. Fitness values of local and optimal populations were derived by fitting population variation to response functions for individual sites. Local optimality was an interval estimate, i.e. within the 95\% confidence limit of the projected fitness value of the optimal populations. Both biological and physical distances between local and optimal population were used to examine geographic pattern of local optimality. Study leads to following key results: (1) local optimality prevails at majority of sites; (2) populations at northeast bordering the northern Rocky Mountain Trench are most local optimal, whereas non-local optimality most evident along the eastern foothills of the Coastal Mountains in the coast-interior transition climate zone and the high mountains in the southern interior; (3) there is a geographic cline oriented from southwest to northeast, but with a steep west-east incline; and (4) along component dimensions, a steep longitudinal cline, i.e. the farther the west, the lesser the local optimality, and an elevational cline, i.e. the higher the elevation, the lesser the local optimality. Based on the ecological and life-history characteristics of the species and the climate in interior British Columbia, we propose that a selection gradient coupled with directional gene flow was the process influencing the formation of the observed geographic pattern. The selection gradient parallels the general climate pattern from continental northeast to sub-continental southwest. The gene flow brought the migration of undesirable genes from the coastal subspecies contorta to interior populations of the subspecies latifolia, which further diminished the effectiveness of natural selection. Practical applications through seed transfer in reforestation and genetic resources management are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop Populus as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the Populus genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the Populus genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the Populus genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the Populus genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of Populus as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Ten-year testing results demonstrated large site effects. Noble fir planted in the Maritime climate survived better, grew faster, entered the period of accelerated growth earlier, and maintained a higher growth rate. In the Maritime climate, the reforestation range of noble fir can be extended considerably north of its current natural distribution and to lower elevations. Low winter temperature and growing-season soil moisture appear to be the major environmental factors limiting the species' expansion into more continental climates, and these factors must be considered in planting site selection. Provenance differences in both growth and survival were significant but small compared to site differences. Adaptive variation showed gentle geographic clines indicating that northern provenances were better adapted in the Maritime climate, whereas inland provenances were superior in the Submaritime climate. Lack of strong geographic patterns suggests that local environmental factors may be important to the adaptive variation of the species. The test results suggest that introduction of noble fir to British Columbia should be limited to the Maritime region, and that northern provenances, such as French Butte, McKinley Lake, and Stevens Pass in Washington are the primary seed sources.

The objectives were to assess gametic disequilibria and multilocus structure. There was considerable differentiation of allele frequencies at 19 polymorphic loci across the 66 populations and within the subupecies. Allele frequencies at many loci correlated with geographic variables. Genetic variability varied considerably among populations within subspecies but the subspecies means were similar. The mean number of polymorphic loci were. respectively, 13 and 0.194 in latifolia, 12 and 0.196 in murrayana, and 12 and 0.180 in contorta. The mean heterozygosity correlated with longitude and altitude across the 66 populations and with latitued in latifolia. Gametic disequilibria were evident in 40 populations; 29 in latifolia, eight in murrayana and three in contorta. Gametic disequilibria correlated with latitude across the 66 populations and with longitude in latifolia. The single-locus FST averaged 0.0339 in latifolia, 0.0567 in murrayana, and 0.0764 in contorta. The multilocus FSTM was 0.1227 in latifolia, 0.2926+ in murrayana, and 0.3328 in contorta. Multilocus Wahlund and founder effects, migration patterns, and natural selection, probably played significant roles in generating and maintaining the multilocus genetic structure in P. contorta in general and the subspecies latifolia in particular.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact forest growth and survival as tree populations experience climates to which they are not well adapted. However, forest regeneration efforts represent opportunities to introduce genetic material on the landscape that is well matched to future climates. We estimated universal response functions (URF) for two economically and ecologically important tree species in eastern Canada - black spruce (Picea mariana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). The URF approach models tree growth as a function of both the planting site climate (i.e., environmental effects) and seed source climate (i.e., genetic effects), allowing the growth of any seed source to be estimated at any location. Both species exhibited a relatively weak genetic effect, suggesting modest potential for seed movements to mitigate climate change impacts. The optimal provenance for any given location was not local, but rather located in environments that were approximately 1.5. \textdegree{}C warmer than the planting site; this shift is consistent in both direction and magnitude with that expected due to climate warming since the start of the industrial revolution. Both species exhibited a strong environmental effect with clear evidence for a central climatic optimum. As a result, climate warming is expected to enhance black spruce growth at sites with mean annual temperature colder than approximately 4.5. \textdegree{}C and white pine growth at sites colder than 11. \textdegree{}C. Thus, Ontario white pine populations may benefit from the climate changes projected to occur in the province over the next 50-100. years. For black spruce, populations in southern and central Ontario may experience suboptimal climate conditions over the mid-to-end of the current century. Despite the relatively weak genetic effect, climate-smart seed movements could play a role in maintaining the productivity and genetic diversity of black spruce in these areas. While the URF approach has limitations, this work demonstrates its potential for informing regeneration decisions under climate change.},

Understanding the causes and impacts of community\textendash{}outsider conflict can provide important insights into improving forest governance. This study analyzes seven community\textendash{}outsider conflicts from five countries in Southeast Asia. All cases involved local communities in conflict with external actors (e.g. logging and mining companies, plantation estates and conservation agencies). Our findings from these cases suggest that conflict often arises as a result of contested tenure, exclusionary economic development and conservation policies, and a lack of coordination among state agencies related to land-use planning. This study underlines the complex nature of conflict, which often involves not only material issues but also deep cultural connections between communities and their land. Conflict impacts were usually very negative and included fear, anxiety, distrust, division between social groups, and high economic and environmental costs. To a limited extent, conflict impacts were also positive, such as where conflict strengthened collective action at a community level and/or increased awareness of the need to clarify tenure. The study provides a number of practical suggestions to address community\textendash{}outsider conflict and improve forest governance in Southeast Asia.},

Because many species inhabit heterogeneous environments and have pronounced local adaptations, gene flow between differently adapted populations may be a persistent source of genetic variation within populations. If this migration-selection balance is biologically important then there should be strong correlations between genetic variance within populations and the amount of heterogeneity in the environment surrounding them. Here, we use data from a long-term study of 142 populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) to compare levels of genetic variation in growth response with measures of climatic heterogeneity in the surrounding region. We find that regional heterogeneity explains at least 20\% of the variation in genetic variance, suggesting that gene flow and heterogeneous selection may play an important role in maintaining the high levels of genetic variation found within natural populations.},

Even so, studies of local adaptation in heterogeneous environments sometimes find that just a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect can explain a large percentage of observed differences between phenotypically divergent populations. As high levels of gene flow can swamp divergence at weakly selected alleles, migration-selection-drift balance may play an important role in shaping the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Here, we use analytical approximations and individual-based simulations to explore how genetic architecture evolves when two populations connected by migration experience stabilizing selection toward different optima. In contrast to the exponential distribution of allele effect sizes expected under adaptation without migration (Orr 1998), we find that adaptation with migration tends to result in concentrated genetic architectures with fewer, larger, and more tightly linked divergent alleles. Even if many small alleles contribute to adaptation at the outset, they tend to be replaced by a few large alleles under prolonged bouts of stabilizing selection with migration. All else being equal, we also find that stronger selection can maintain linked clusters of locally adapted alleles over much greater map distances than weaker selection. The common empirical finding of QTL of large effect is shown to be expected with migration in a heterogeneous landscape, and these QTL may often be composed of several tightly linked alleles of smaller effect.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies of ecological genetics have found that alleles contributing to local adaptation sometimes cluster together, forming "genomic islands of divergence." Divergence hitchhiking theory posits that these clusters evolve by the preferential establishment of tightly linked locally adapted mutations, because such linkage reduces the rate that recombination breaks up locally favorable combinations of alleles. Here, I use calculations based on previously developed analytical models of divergence hitchhiking to show that very few clustered mutations should be expected in a single bout of adaptation, relative to the number of unlinked mutations, suggesting that divergence hitchhiking theory alone may often be insufficient to explain empirical observations. Using individual-based simulations that allow for the transposition of a single genetic locus from one position on a chromosome to another, I then show that tight clustering of the loci involved in local adaptation tends to evolve on biologically realistic time scales. These results suggest that genomic rearrangements may often be an important component of local adaptation and the evolution of genomic islands of divergence. More generally, these results suggest that genomic architecture and functional neighborhoods of genes may be actively shaped by natural selection in heterogeneous environments. Because small-scale changes in gene order are relatively common in some taxa, comparative genomic studies could be coupled with studies of adaptation to explore how commonly such rearrangements are involved in local adaptation.},

  abstract = {Population genetic models predict that alleles with small selection coefficients may be swamped by migration and will not contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing to standing variation are of small effect, how does local adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing genetic variation (V(G)), and the susceptibility of alleles to swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient V(G). However, in such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is transient: F(ST) is low across all loci, and no locus makes an important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficult--if not impossible--to detect using current approaches to studying the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the architecture of local adaptation, both through eroding V(G) and affecting the rate of turnover of polymorphisms with redundant phenotypic effects.},

Adapting boreal resource management to atmospheric change requires a holistic understanding and awareness of the ongoing and future responses of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in this vast, heterogeneous landscape. To integrate existing knowledge of and generate new insights from the broad-scale impacts of atmospheric change, we first describe historical and present trends ({$\sim$}1980\textendash{}2015) in temperature, precipitation, deposition of hazardous air pollutants, and atmospheric-mediated natural disturbance regimes in this region. We then examine their associations with ecosystem condition and productivity, biological diversity, soil and water, and the carbon budget. These associations vary considerably among ecozones and likely undergo further changes under the emerging risks of atmospheric change. We highlight the urgent need to establish long-term, boreal-wide monitoring for many key components of freshwater ecosystems to better understand and project the influences of atmospheric change on boreal water resources. We also formulate three divergent future scenarios of boreal ecosystems in 2050. Our scenario analysis reveals multiple undesirable changes in boreal ecosystem structure and functioning with more variable atmospheric conditions and frequent land disturbances, while continuing business-as-usual management of natural resources. It is possible, though challenging, to reduce unwanted consequences to ecosystems through management regimes focussed on socio-ecological sustainability and developing resilient infrastructure and adaptive resource-management strategies. We emphasize the need for proactive actions and improved foresight for all sectors of society to collaborate, innovate, and invest in anticipation of impending global atmospheric change, without which the boreal zone will face a dim future.},

Loci with the strongest association to these climate gradients tagged genome regions with high sequence similarity to genes with functional roles in thermal tolerance, drought tolerance, or resistance to herbivores of pathogens. Genotypes at these candidate loci also predicted the performance of an independent sample of plant accessions grown in climate-controlled conditions. Compared to a genome-wide sample of randomly drawn reference SNPs, candidates for two climate gradients, AMT and PWM, were significantly enriched for genic regions, and genome segments flanking genic AMT and PWM candidates harbored less nucleotide diversity, elevated differentiation between haplotypes carrying alternate alleles, and an overrepresentation of the most common haplotypes. These patterns of diversity are consistent with a history of soft selective sweeps acting on loci underlying adaptation to climate, but not with a history of long-term balancing selection.},

This model has unstable equilibria at which variation in interaction outcomes is maintained, even as mutualism persists; and coevolution of host recognition and symbiont signalling is modulated by coevolution of sanctions and cooperation. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure show that, compared to simpler models, the dual-system model 20 promotes greater local and among-population variation in hosts and maintains among-population variation in symbionts. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition also converge toward conditions similar to economic models of symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. Our results reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism 25 must consider communication between partner species as well as the exchange of benefits.},

With a data set of 202 accessions of Medicago truncatula genotyped at almost 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, we used mixed linear models to identify candidate loci responsible for adaptation to three climatic gradients\textemdash{}annual mean temperature (AMT), precipitation in the wettest month (PWM), and isothermality (ITH)\textemdash{}representing the major axes of climate variation across the species' range. Loci with the strongest association to these climate gradients tagged genome regions with high sequence similarity to genes with functional roles in thermal tolerance, drought tolerance, or resistance to herbivores of pathogens. Genotypes at these candidate loci also predicted the performance of an independent sample of plant accessions grown in climatecontrolled conditions. Compared to a genome-wide sample of randomly drawn reference SNPs, candidates for two climate gradients, AMT and PWM, were significantly enriched for genic regions, and genome segments flanking genic AMT and PWM candidates harbored less nucleotide diversity, elevated differentiation between haplotypes carrying alternate alleles, and an overrepresentation of the most common haplotypes. These patterns of diversity are consistent with a history of soft selective sweeps acting on loci underlying adaptation to climate, but not with a history of long-term balancing selection.},

Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality \textemdash{} yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance, but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts' ability 20 to sanction non-cooperative symbionts and ability to recognize symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts' cooperation and expression of signals.

Individual-based simulations incorporating 25 population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality.

To answer this question, we examined the demographic genetics of Quercus bambusifolia over a 70-year recovery period in highly fragmented forests in Hong Kong. We sampled 1138 individuals from 37 locations, and genetically analysed the chronosequence through the classification of tree diameters from the same populations using 13 microsatellite markers. Our study reveals that severe fragmentation caused a significant genetic bottleneck with very few remaining but genetically diverse individuals. We observed an enhanced genetic diversity during demographic recovery. We found full-sibs within populations and half-sibs across the study range. This reflects a limited seed dispersal and extensive pollen flow. Despite reduced genetic structure both among and within populations, overall a strong persisting genetic differentiation (F{${'}$}ST\,=\,0.240, P\,{$<$}\,0.01) and significant small-scale spatial genetic structure (F(1)\,=\,0.13, Sp\,=\,0.024, P\,{$<$}\,0.01) were observed. Existing bottlenecks and low effective population sizes within the temporal chronosequence suggest that the long-term effect of severe fragmentation cannot be entirely eliminated by wind pollination with demographic recovery in the absence of effective seed dispersal. Our results lead to recommendations for forest management.},

This study illustrates an upscaling approach to studying the spatiotemporal pattern of ecosystem processes in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in northeastern China by integrating simulation modeling, GIS, remote sensing data, and field-based observations. The ecosystem model incorporated processes of energy transfer, plant physiology, carbon dynamics, and water cycling. Using a direct extrapolation scheme, the patch-level ecosystem model was scaled up to quantify the landscape-level pattern of primary productivity and the carbon source-sink relationship. The simulated net primary productivity (NPP) for the entire landscape, consisting of several ecosystem types, was 0.680 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). The most widely distributed ecosystem type in this region was the mixed broad-leaved and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest, which had the highest NPP (1.084 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). The total annual NPP for all ecosystem types combined was estimated to be 1.332 Mt C yr(-1). These results suggest that the Changbai Mountain landscape as a whole was a carbon sink, with a net carbon sequestration rate of about 0.884 Mt C yr(-1) for the study period. The simulated NPP agreed reasonably well with available field measurements at a number of locations within the study landscape. Our study provides new insight into the relationship between landscape pattern and ecosystem processes, and useful information for improving management practices in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, which is one of the most important forested landscapes in China. Several research needs are discussed to further refine the modeling approach and reduce prediction uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Exposure to bioaerosol allergens such as pollen can cause exacerbations of allergenic airway disease (AAD) in sensitive populations, and thus cause serious public health problems. Assessing these health impacts by linking the airborne pollen levels, concentrations of respirable allergenic material, and human allergenic response under current and future climate conditions is a key step toward developing preventive and adaptive actions. To that end, a regional-scale pollen emission and transport modeling framework was developed that treats allergenic pollens as non-reactive tracers within the WRF/CMAQ air-quality modeling system. The Simulator of the Timing and Magnitude of Pollen Season (STaMPS) model was used to generate a daily pollen pool that can then be emitted into the atmosphere by wind. The STaMPS is driven by species-specific meteorological (temperature and/or precipitation) threshold conditions and is designed to be flexible with respect to its representation of vegetation species and plant functional types (PFTs). The hourly pollen emission flux was parameterized by considering the pollen pool, friction velocity, and wind threshold values. The dry deposition velocity of each species of pollen was estimated based on pollen grain size and density. An evaluation of the pollen modeling framework was conducted for southern California for the period from March to June 2010. This period coincided with observations by the University of Southern California's Children's Health Study (CHS), which included O3, PM2.5, and pollen count, as well as measurements of exhaled nitric oxide in study participants. Two nesting domains with horizontal resolutions of 12 km and 4 km were constructed, and six representative allergenic pollen genera were included: birch tree, walnut tree, mulberry tree, olive tree, oak tree, and brome grasses. Under the current parameterization scheme, the modeling framework tends to underestimate walnut and peak oak pollen concentrations, and tends to overestimate grass pollen concentrations. The model shows reasonable agreement with observed birch, olive, and mulberry tree pollen concentrations. Sensitivity studies suggest that the estimation of the pollen pool is a major source of uncertainty for simulated pollen concentrations. Achieving agreement between emission modeling and observed pattern of pollen releases is the key for successful pollen concentration simulations.},

How such a daily-asymmetric warming modifies plant phenology is still unclear. We investigated the effects of asymmetric warming on bud break by daily monitoring seedlings belonging to 26 black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.] and 15 balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] provenances from the native range in Canada. Seedlings were subjected to either daytime or nighttime warming in three growth chambers at temperatures ranging between 10 and 24 \textdegree{}C. On average, a warming of 4 \textdegree{}C advanced the timings of bud break in both species by 2.4 days, with the later phases being more sensitive to the treatment. Bud break of both species responded more strongly to daytime warming, with the bud break occurred 1.2 and 3.2 days earlier under daytime than nighttime warming in black spruce and balsam fir, respectively. A marked ecotypic differentiation was only observed in black spruce that originated from provenances distributed broadly across Canada, with seedlings from the warmest provenance completing bud break 8.3 days later than those from the coldest one. However, no significant effect of provenance was observed for balsam fir, the narrowly distributed species. Overall, the above results suggest that a higher temporal resolution such as temperatures during daytime and nighttime, and higher spatial resolution should be taken into account to improve the accuracy of phenological model predictions under global change scenarios. Phenological models based on daily average temperature should take into account the diverging impacts of asymmetric warming on plant phenology. Our findings may indicate that the influence of warming on plant phenology may be less dramatic than expected.},

In response to global warming, off- spring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipita- tion change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7\% of the tree spe- cies examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7\%) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3\%). Only 4.3\% are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When com- pared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no con- sistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

  abstract = {One-fifth of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are sequestered by the terrestrial biosphere, where forests serve as an important ``natural solution'' to climate change (1). Forests are expected to persist as a substantial carbon sink, dampening future rises in atmospheric CO2 levels (2{$\Downarrow$}\textendash{}4). However, a significant part of this carbon uptake occurs in forests regrowing from past land-use changes or natural disturbances. A clear example is the landscape history of central New England in the United States, where significant transformations have occurred: from pristine old-growth forests to clear-cut areas giving way to agriculture, to old-field succession, and to expansion of regrowth forests (Fig. 1). As more forests approach old-growth conditions, their rate of carbon uptake may begin to decline. To anticipate the future of the global carbon sink, Pugh et al. (5) show that it is necessary to account for forest regrowth and demography and to consider the broader issue of the terrestrial biosphere's ultimate capacity to sequester carbon.

  abstract = {Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of "missing heritability" of common traits. Although studies have discovered {$>$}1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator--that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from overestimation of the denominator, creating "phantom heritability." Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified, because models with interactions are also consistent with observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of heritability explained much larger. For example, 80\% of the currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not directly correspond to missing variants, because current estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not inflated by genetic interactions.},
